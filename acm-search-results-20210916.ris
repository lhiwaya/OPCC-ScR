AB  - Evidence from the literature and observation conducted from various practice in managing project or developing product within the organization suggested that human factors in term of control and direction can be the greatest threats to the organization to ensure the high quality of information security. Therefore, fewer research was conducted towards assessing the level of end-user awareness in a practical way to extract the relationship of demographic factor with user compliance in order to understand the working mechanism. Thus, this study prepares a literature review with the PRISMA model to implement a systematic process in an integrated manner in order to reveal representative information on the subject. Subsequently, a correspondence analysis (CA) was conducted to discover the hidden meaning of the relevant demographic factors that might affect the intention to comply with the organization's policy to protect confidential, sensitive and confidential information. One interesting result stated that ethnicity provides a stronger association by providing a total variation of 0.121, singular value of 0.248, chi-square of 26.208 and standard deviation of 0.063.

AB  - As organizations' reliance on information technology (IT) continues to grow, the information technology personnel who support end users play an increasingly important role in the proper functioning of those organizations. In the present study, we interviewed information technology personnel (N=32) as well as other employees (N=89) to examine their intra-group and inter-group communications and assess the existence and importance of the occupational culture of IT personnel within organizations. We applied Trice's Occupational Subculture theoretical framework (1993) to examine the characteristics of the occupational culture of IT personnel and its relationships with other type of personnel within organizations. The results of our study suggest that IT personnel have established a distinct occupational culture within organizations, characterized, for example, by the use of technical jargon, primary value of technical knowledge, extreme and unusual demands on people in the profession related to the constant change of IT, feelings of superiority and a general lack of formal rules. Conflicts between IT occupational subcultures and other extant subcultures arise from cultural differences

AB  - With advances in the areas of telecommunications, computing and miniaturization of computers, the use of mobile technology is becoming prevalent within organizations. Consequently, a shift towards a nomadic computing environment, capable of supporting workers anywhere and anytime, is commonly observed. While many of the issues associated with such environments are technological in nature, this paper focuses on the social aspect of the shift to a nomadic computing environment, and examines its impact of employees' ability to effectively collaborate with one another. Studying changes at the individual level, we argue that an increase in workers' social mobility, brought upon by the move to a nomadic computing environment, is likely to have a negative effect on their social capital. Social capital has been shown to positively impact collaboration in various settings, including the workplace. We further argue that the above negative effect is contingent upon the type of mobile technology used by nomadic workers. The paper concludes with suggestions for model extensions and avenues for future research.

AB  - People are the only constant component of any software project. Diversity of cultures, behavioral patterns, and life scripts leads to different understanding and meaning of interactions and information exchange among team members. As processes that follow Agile methodology approaches consider individuals and interaction as the highest priority, it was decided to analyze communication issues in teams who work by such processes. The work presents an overview of obstacles for effective communication based on literature review. The survey among 53 respondents was conducted to evaluate the most common communication challenges which Agile teams face in their work. These challenges are further mapped with communication theories. On the basis of the mapping, we developed recommendations for overcoming problems described in each of the theories. The results of the work could be used by people with managerial roles in Agile teams to learn more about the root causes of ineffective communication among team members. The solutions and recommendations could be used to overcome these issues.

T3  - SAICSIT '14
AB  - Mobile Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has taken the consumer market by storm and throughout the past two decades it has spilled into the corporate world. Since mobile ICT exists in complex technological, social and organisational environments, mobility deployments mostly remain piecemeal, existing as islands of independent technologies not leading to any business transformation.The purpose of this study is to develop a generic framework that guides organisations from the beginning to the end in achieving mobile transformation through the adoption of mobile ICT. Mobile transformation refers to the organisation's prudent deployment of mobile ICT to significantly modify its business strategy, strategic processes, operating procedures and organisational interfaces. This paper presents a compendium of opinions from market leaders in the mobile ICT field, it studies the methods proposed in academic journals and then develops an adoption approach for mobility. It illustrates and discusses those elements that are essential for planning and preparing to achieve business transformation through the use of mobility. The most important elements to consider are: implementing a top-down managerial planning approach; the relevant individual-organisational- and technological factors associated with mobility; taking appropriate measures to ensure that the organisation is ready for the adoption; determining an inclusive method of calculating the cost versus benefit calculation; and considering the practical issues of which security is the most pertinent. If implement correctly, mobility can lead the organisation into a plethora of benefits and completely transform the enterprise.

AB  - One challenge of telework before the Covid-19 pandemic, but even during it, is that even if organizations offer telework programs employees are not willing to work from home. Instead, they prefer to stay in the office. We conducted a literature review of 32 studies focusing on telework adoption to propose the employee telework adoption model, informing research and practice about telework and its successful implementation. Guided by the theory of planned behavior we identified six behavioral beliefs fostering telework adoption and five behavioral beliefs hindering telework adoption. Moreover, we reveal one normative and three control beliefs that foster or hinder it. This belief set constitues the employee telework adoption model, which is further discussed in terms of its implications for research and its guidance for future research endoveaurs.

AB  - The utilization of new technologies by the public sector differs from the one by private companies and individuals. Regarding technologies that enable transparency, openness and outside participation (those usually associated with the term Open Government), not only a limited knowledge of the relevant technologies and capabilities, but also cultural and organizational factors can hinder their implementation. In this study we analyze such factors and ask about their relevance in the German speaking region. In the working group Open Government in the interdisciplinary research cooperation ISPRAT e.V. researchers used a methodological mix of qualitative and quantitative data. Four focus groups and six telephone interviews within different levels of management in the public sector were conducted to identify the relevant factors. Furthermore, a representative quantitative survey was extended by study-specific questions. As result, three key areas regarding the potential cultural and organizational barriers are presented: information cultures and divergent interests in agencies, limited innovation potential in organizational cultures and limited communication of strategies. From this analysis, further implications and some recommendations are derived.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a participatory design process for a collaborative childcare service based on co-worker participation and supported by a digital sharing platform. We conducted semi-structured interviews, focus groups and co-design workshops with 41 employees and HR managers of six knowledge organizations. We investigated their views on participative forms of welfare, the factors that can sustain or hinder collaboration among co-workers and the role technology can play in sustaining these practices. The findings shed light on perceived values and potential barriers of social and organizational arrangements as well as the mediating role of interpersonal trust, social exchange and reciprocity. Furthermore, the results provide insights on how digital platforms can support orchestration and management of collaborative practices grounded on employee participation and on the interplay between work and family life spheres.

AB  - In today's world, the security of companies' data is given a very big emphasis than ever. Despite huge investments made by companies to keep their systems safe, there are many information systems security breaches that infiltrate companies' systems and consequently affect their economic capacity, reputation, and customers' confidence. The literature suggests that almost all investments in information systems security have been focused only on technological solutions. However, having this partial view on the complex information systems security problem is found to be insufficient and hence there is an increasing call for researchers to include social factors into the solution space. One of such social factor is culture. Thus, in this research we studied how national culture influence employees' intention to violate or comply their company ISS policy. We construct and test an empirical model by using a survey data obtained from employees who are working in Ethiopia.

T3  - ICEGOV '17
AB  - Overcoming data and information challenges in emergency response increasingly requires the use of collaborative data analytics (CDA). CDA represents the collaborative processes of various actors with different expertise and affiliations to jointly analyze data using advanced information technologies and sophisticated techniques. The purpose of this paper is to propose a preliminary framework to examine the factors and challenges pertinent to CDA in emergency situations. The framework proposed in this paper classifies the challenges and determinants of CDA into four broad categories: (1) skills-related, (2) organizational, (3) political, and (4) technological. The four components influence how CDA works and influence how each expert interacts with one another to analyze data, make collective decisions, and synthesize crisis learning. In turn, the lessons identified from crisis learning will be used to refine the data analysis process in the CDA effort. In addition, the processes and outcomes of CDA, as well as the resulting crisis learning, are affected by the type of crisis at hand.

AB  - Endpoint security is a major concern of IT management staff as the cost of data loss is high in monetary value and consumer confidence. Sensitive data, traditionally, has been threatened by physical theft of hardcopy or a device containing sensitive data. Recently, with the advent of USB-based applications, the threats presented towards sensitive data have increased dramatically. IT managers should employ a layered defense-in-depth strategy to mitigate the risks posed by these devices. The strategy should include hardware and software based mitigation techniques, an acceptable use policy, and a security education program to maintain vigilance in security practices.

TI  - What Are the Most Important Factors for Accounting Information Quality and Their Impact on AIS Data Quality Outcomes?
AU  - Xu, Hongjiang
T2  - J. Data and Information Quality
AB  - The accounting information system (AIS) is one of the most critical systems in any organization. Data quality plays a critical role in a data-intensive, knowledge-based economy. The objective of this study is to identify the most important factors for accounting information quality and their impact on AIS data quality outcomes. The article includes an extensive literature review and summarizes studies in quality management, data quality, accounting information systems, and enterprise planning in helping to identify a set of critical success factors for data quality. The study uses empirical data to answer the research question and test the research hypothesis. Study results show that the top three most important factors that affect accounting information systems‚Äô data quality are top management commitment, the nature of the accounting information systems (such as the suitability of the systems), and input controls. The article further uses regression analysis to test the effect of those factors on AIS data quality, finding that there is a significant positive relationship between the perceived performance of the three most important factors and perceived AIS data quality outcomes.

AB  - This study is an empirical study of the factors affecting cyber security breach. Based on the previous researches, factors affecting information security were classified into three aspects of system management, policy and institution, awareness and culture, and measurement items were constructed for each. As a result, outsourcing of information security, data backup, information security awareness by top management and employees were significant influencing variables. The analysis results show that the elements of cognitive aspect are very important. This should be remembered in security that eventually the acceptance of the members who use the security system safely and observe the relevant rules is very important.

AB  - With a backdrop of economic turmoil in recent history composed of a severe recession and slow recovery, there is timely motivation to explain the important role that collective memory plays in occupational culture. Based on the lens of cultural sociology and Halbwach's theory of collective memory, the findings uncover the heroes and origin stories that form the collective memory of the IT occupation in order to answer the research question "What are the important elements of collective memory in IT occupational culture?" The findings include elements of economic downturns, layoffs, outsourcing, job-hopping, 9/11, Silicon Valley, and increased regulation, as well as common heroes and origins. A hermeneutic interpretation is offered to further explain the importance of the results for both theory and practice.

T2  - ACM Comput. Surv.
AB  - Software engineering evolved from a rigid process to a dynamic interplay of people (e.g., stakeholders or developers). Organizational and social literature call this interplay an Organizational Social Structure (OSS). Software practitioners still lack a systematic way to select, analyze, and support OSSs best fitting their problems (e.g., software development). We provide the state-of-the-art in OSSs, and discuss mechanisms to support OSS-related decisions in software engineering (e.g., choosing the OSS best fitting development scenarios). Our data supports two conclusions. First, software engineering focused on building software using project teams alone, yet these are one of thirteen OSS flavors from literature. Second, an emerging OSS should be further explored for software development: social networks. This article represents a first glimpse at OSS-aware software engineering, that is, to engineer software using OSSs best fit for the problem.

TI  - Curiosity Killed the Organization: A Psychological Comparison between Malicious and Non-Malicious Insiders and the Insider Threat
AU  - Dupuis, Marc
AU  - Khadeer, Samreen
T3  - RIIT '16
AB  - Insider threats remain a significant problem within organizations, especially as industries that rely on technology continue to grow. Traditionally, research has been focused on the malicious insider; someone that intentionally seeks to perform a malicious act against the organization that trusts him or her. While this research is important, more commonly organizations are the victims of non-malicious insiders. These are trusted employees that are not seeking to cause harm to their employer; rather, they misuse systems-either intentional or unintentionally-that results in some harm to the organization. In this paper, we look at both by developing and validating instruments to measure the behavior and circumstances of a malicious insider versus a non-malicious insider. We found that in many respects their psychological profiles are very similar. The results are also consistent with other research on the malicious insider from a personality standpoint. We expand this and also find that trait negative affect, both its higher order dimension and the lower order dimensions, are highly correlated with insider threat behavior and circumstances. This paper makes four significant contributions: 1) Development and validation of survey instruments designed to measure the insider threat; 2) Comparison of the malicious insider with the non-malicious insider; 3) Inclusion of trait affect as part of the psychological profile of an insider; 4) Inclusion of a measure for financial well-being, and 5) The successful use of survey research to examine the insider threat problem.

T3  - dg.o '08
AB  - Public management philosophies and practices around the world have undergone dramatic reshaping over the last two decades. Political courses on privatization and the wide-scope adoption of information technologies are, undoubtedly, among the most influential factors behind these changes. Scholarly literature devoted to outsourcing of public IT to private vendors, a phenomenon lying at the intersection of the two abovementioned strong trends, is the focus of this paper.Research of IT outsourcing issues specific to the governmental agencies is represented by few geographically and disciplinary dispersed academic publications. We expect many issues to be shared by public organizations around the world, at least within countries with similar political systems; however, governments employ different mechanisms for funding and control; the scope of restrictions and provision of guidelines vary from country to country. The proposed study reviews a diverse international set of publications in management, IS and public policy fields, while accounting for contextual differences and recognizing the limitations for generalizability. The findings are summarized into two categories ‚Äì common identified reasons for public IT outsourcing, and issues and concerns about IT outsourcing that are distinct or significantly different for the public sector.

AB  - Background: Software engineering work and its context often has characteristics of what in social science is termed 'messy'; it has ephemeral and irregular qualities. This puts high demands on researchers doing inquiry and analysis. Aims: This paper aims to show what a combination of situational analysis (SA) and narrative analysis (NA) can bring to qualitative software engineering research, and in particular for situations characterised by mess. Method: SA and NA were applied to a case study on software security. Results: We found that these analysis methods helped us gain new insights and understandings and a broader perspective of the situation we are studying. Additionally, the methods helped collaboration in the analysis. Conclusion: We recommend applying and studying these and similar combinations of analysis approaches further.

T3  - CHI '92
AB  - Collaborations in organizations thrive on communication that is informal because informal communication is frequent, interactive, and expressive. Informal communication is crucial for the coordination of work, learning an organization's culture, the perpetuation of the social relations that underlie collaboration, and, in general, any situation that requires communication to resolve ambiguity. Informal communication is traditionally mediated by physical proximity, but physical proximity cannot mediate in geographically distributed organizations. The research described here evaluates the adequacy of a version of a desktop video/audio conferencing system for supporting informal communication in a research and development laboratory. The evaluation took place during a trial in which the system was used by summer employees and their supervisor-mentors. While the system was used frequently, the most common uses and users' assessments suggest that it was used more like a telephone or electronic mail than like physically mediated face-to-face communication. However, some features of its use transcended traditional media and allowed users to gain awareness of their work environment. The paper concludes with a discussion of requirements for successful technology to support informal communication.

T3  - NSPW '20
AB  - Practices such as open source development, agile, DevOps and DevSecOps mean that cyber security professionals need to find ways to blend cyber security with software development practices. One way of approaching this is as an awareness, education and training problem and many organisations are focusing on training software developers in cyber security. In this paper, however, we make the case for looking more broadly at group rather than individual behaviours, by examining the social practices of software developers. Changing software development practices are shaping the lived experience of software developers and we argue that understanding these practices will enable us to improve secure software development. We use social practice theory as a framework to develop recommendations for aligning and blending cyber security and software development. To achieve this, we carried out a rapid review of research on software development practices and supplemented this with data from ten key informant interviews to ascertain what we need to consider when developing an intervention for secure software development. Finally, we outline how our research could be used to develop a workshop that would facilitate the co-creation of security practices for software development. We conclude with suggestions for future research.

TI  - Smart Cyber-Physical Systems: Beyond Usable Security to Security Ergonomics by Design
AU  - Craggs, Barnaby

T3  - SEsCPS '17
AB  - Securing cyber-physical systems is hard. They are complex infrastructures comprising multiple technological artefacts, designers, operators and users. Existing research has established the security challenges in such systems as well as the role of usable security to support humans in effective security decisions and actions. In this paper we focus on smart cyber-physical systems, such as those based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Such smart systems aim to intelligently automate a variety of functions, with the goal of hiding that complexity from the user. Furthermore, the interactions of the user with such systems are more often implicit than explicit, for instance, a pedestrian with wearables walking through a smart city environment will most likely interact with the smart environment implicitly through a variety of inferred preferences based on previously provided or automatically collected data. The key question that we explore is that of empowering software engineers to pragmatically take into account how users make informed security choices about their data and information in such a pervasive environment. We discuss a range of existing frameworks considering the impact of automation on user behaviours and argue for the need of a shift‚Äîfrom usability to security ergonomics as a key requirement when designing and implementing security features in smart cyber-physical environments. Of course, the considerations apply more broadly than security but, in this paper, we focus only on security as a key concern.

TI  - A Framework for Health Care Information Assurance Policy and Compliance
AU  - Cannoy, Sherrie Drye
AU  - Salam, A. F.
T2  - Commun. ACM
AB  - IntroductionAs many as 400 people may have access to one's personal medical information throughout the typical care process. Disclosures of sensitive information such as emotional problems, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and genetic predispositions to diseases‚Äîcould cause embarrassment and affect insurability, child custody cases, and employment. A recent survey by IDC found that "Most consumers ‚Ä¶were uncomfortable with their health plan sharing health information with a hospital, a specialist or their primary care doctor‚Ä¶ (and) were concerned with who saw their information and were worried that the information could be made available online‚Ä¶ (and) other respondents said they didn't trust their health plan or hospital to protect their information." Clearly, patients (consumers) feel that it is critical that their medical information is held in confidence. If patients do not feel that their personal medical information will be kept confidential, they may withhold important medical information from health care providers making it difficult to provide quality and effective health care.This issue of safeguarding sensitive patient information has become even more critical given that the Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI), in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), may consist of a patient's medical, demographic and insurance information. Thus, presenting a significant information assurance and security challenge to the health care industry as reflected by the consumers' concerns related to building trust with health care community. If the health care industry falls behind in assuring the public that it can indeed safeguard patient information, then the initiative to create a more efficient and cost effective health care system by using Information Technology will be in serious jeopardy. The research presented in this article addresses this important information assurance and security challenge by building upon past research and presenting a framework of Information Assurance and Compliance developed through multi-site case study approach involving multiple health care providers in the U.S.Mercuri correctly identified that "solutions (to the information assurance challenge) are not as simple as adding on security tools and providing employees with policies and procedures for their job classification and requiring them to read and sign off on them." Information Assurance (IA) technologies such as encryption, password protection, access control mechanisms, and so on, for PHI may not be sufficient, since not all individual health care professionals may be familiar with the requirements of the law nor sufficiently motivated or trained to protect private and sensitive patient information. Health care Information Assurance policy (IA Policy) may be in place due to HIPPA requirements, but if health care employees fail to comply with such policy then patient information will be at a risk for disclosure. In this context, Mercuri correctly underscores the importance of human and management factors related to compliance by stating that "‚Ä¶the workers (must be given) a sufficient period in which to incorporate the new structures and rules into their culture and ethics. Otherwise efforts (related to IA Policy compliance) may be frustrated and unsuccessful."Even though human and management factors, related to compliance, have been recognized as important as technical factors in providing security to PHI in the health care industry, there is a lack of well-developed framework to understand IA policy compliance factors addressing the behavioral dimension in the context of patient health care information. Without such a framework, it is difficult to develop both managerial interventions and research studies in this important area of health care information assurance. The purpose of this research (using multi-site case research approach) is to present such a research framework that examines what factors affect health care employee's behavior to comply with information assurance (IA) policy related to protection of patient health care information. We also present sample measures to assess individual compliance.In the light of recent breaches and/ or theft of sensitive consumer data from banking, academic institutions, government agencies, and health care providers, this study provides a framework that can be extended and adapted to understand IA Policy issues in health care as well as in other industries. Therefore, the implication of this study is much broader and can be extended to other industries with appropriate adaptation.The unifying foundation for our research framework is the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA posits that external factors affect beliefs and beliefs in turn affect attitudes, and attitudes affect intention which ultimately affect one's behavior. We examine how these concepts are related to one's behavior in complying with information assurance policy regarding patient health information. Using TRA, we build our framework on solid theoretical foundations drawing from research in technology acceptance model, information assurance and security, ethical behavior, organizational culture4 and health information management.

AB  - Software development methodologies are constantly evolving due to changing technologies and new demands from users. Today's dynamic business environment has given rise to emergent organizations that continuously adapt their structures, strategies, and policies to suit the new environment [12]. Such organizations need information systems that constantly evolve to meet their changing requirements‚Äîbut the traditional, plan-driven software development methodologies lack the flexibility to dynamically adjust the development process.

AB  - This research presents the design of a board game that explores Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Information Technologies (IT) for the Disaster and Risk Management (DRM) domain. The game aims to support circumspect discussions of issues emerging at cross-border, cross-sector, interoperation and data management such as privacy, trust, accountability, non-discrimination, and security. IsITethical? board game is both a tool and a process of collaboratively building worlds in which ELSI guidance can be discussed, developed further and applied in preferable near futures. The original idea emerged from the research deliverables of the ELSI work package of SecInCoRe (2014‚Äì17), a large-scale EU funded research project concerned with IT for DRM Common Information Spaces (CIS). SecInCoRe's first prototype of the game was further developed and tested in the context of IsITethical?Exchange (2017‚Äì2019), a UK Research Innovation funded service co-design project, that explores the idea of ethical impact assessment as a creative collaborative process. This paper offers insights from designing and playing of IsITethical? that begun as a project to make ELSI guidance accessible, but that ultimately opened the way for a much bigger journey, including an online community of practitioners, a living knowledge base, a travelling tool kit for ethical impact assessment service, a methodology to do ethics, and the developing of Ethics through Design framework, that both reformulates ideas of Ethics and ideas of Human-Computer Interaction Design.

AB  - The growing demand for software requires increasingly productive people and organizations, yet little is known about how best to select, train, organize, and manage people and organizations to produce software. Boehm's COCOMO software costing model has shown that people and organizations can have a dramatic effect on productivity and costs. Issues of project organization, education and training, professional development, career paths, personnel selection, evaluation, group dynamics, and motivation play a significant part in software productivity. As this review of 130 references to the recent research literature indicates, work is being done on these issues, however, some gaps need to be filled and methods developed to insure their effective use.

AB  - The main objective of this research is to propose and present the Open Government Implementation Model (OGIM), which is a stage model that prescribes and guides government agencies on their journey to open government. The OGIM defines four implementation stages and describes the focuses, deliverables, benefits, challenges, best practices, and metrics for each stage. A thesis of the OGIM states that government agencies should advance their open government initiatives in a progressive and orderly manner by focusing on one implementation stage at a time, starting from increasing data transparency (Stage 1), and then moving on to improving open participation (Stage 2), enhancing open collaboration (Stage 3), and realizing ubiquitous engagement (Stage 4). We argue that, by following this sequence, agencies can minimize risk and effectively harness the power of social media in order to engage the public.

AB  - Mobile handheld devices are an increasing part of everyday fieldwork of news professionals. Mobile assignments delivered to mobile journalists' smartphones are one potential future development step. We present findings on using mobile assignments from two exploratory user studies in which smartphones were used as news reporting tools. Mobile assignments were perceived as handy for fast reporting situations and simple stories but challenging in case of more complex tasks. Structured information content of assignments, process phase based information and supporting situation and activity awareness would support the work of both editorial staff and mobile journalists. The locationing of reporters for sending location-based assignments was found acceptable for coordinating the work although some privacy concerns were expressed. The findings provide new information on using mobile assignments in work where carrying out tasks involves creativity and the tasks may be complex, not strictly limited or they may not have clear completion criteria.

AB  - The idea of having a program which writes other programs based on specifications provided by humans was born very early in the history of computing. After going through several "winters" because of the results not living up to the high expectations, the idea is again popular and some commercial applications already exist, under the generic name of robotic process automation. It so happens that at the same time several other apparently unrelated fields to program synthesis, some of them also veterans of several "winters" (e.g. AI) are also enjoy high interest both in the scientific community and in business: AI, Machine Learning, Deep [Reinforced] Learning, Process Mining, Intention Mining, Cybersecurity.Recent cyberattacks showed they can put lives in danger and create ecological disasters. That revelation came at a time when for various reasons our reliance and dependence on digital technologies is increasing fast. The threat, the dependence, the a severe global shortage in manpower in the field of cybersecurity and the commercial success of robotic process automation makes it worthwhile to look for ways to improve cybersecurity by means of automation.The paper explores several less than obvious ways in which many of the popular-bordering-hype current technologies might assist in robotic process automation in cybersecurity.

This paper aims at shedding light on obstacles hindering mainly e-government implementation from two perspectives: the supply- and the demand-side of e-government services. The contribution to research is seen in summarized insights into what obstacles in e-government were identified in prior research and the suggestion of a classification of obstacles into the two categories of formal and informal obstacles. Literature was reviewed following a conceptual model encompassing a merger and extension of existing approaches. A process of identifying obstacles and improving services in the form of a loop is discussed before possible future research lines will be pointed to.

T3  - ICIS '09
AB  - Today the expression of electronic government (e-government) is a synonym for a modern and efficient administration, and goes well beyond providing constituents with government information and services by leveraging information and communication technologies (ICT). The desired goal is that of convergence characterized by ubiquitous access to government information and services and total transparency of government functioning. Over the past several years, there has been unprecedented change in the way that volumes of data, information and knowledge is created, stored, disseminated and used. Over this period, there have been significant steps forward in government's information management, and there are plenty of examples of good progress in specific areas. These show improvements can be made with effective leadership and management, and they provide experience that can be used more widely. Knowledge management (KM) is a distinct contribution of the private sector as a competitive advantage and knowledge capital hold the sway. It is only recently that KM has started making entry to public sector. One of the reasons for this development has been the emergence of ICT and knowledge worker in the knowledge economy. To deliver more innovative services to demanding public, governments must be involved in the deployment of such new services as e-government and e-commerce. The challenge for e-government is to find a successful way of re-engineering and distributing the administration's knowledge and active management of their knowledge assets is mandatory for success. This paper discusses the KM for e-government development in significance and role, and addresses the KM key issues, activities and questions whether the KM approach that has proven to be successful in business environment is applicable to the provision of public sector services.

T3  - ASONAM '19
AB  - Open source software (OSS) is a core part of virtually all software applications today. Due to the rapidly growing impact of OSS on society and the economy, the security aspect has attracted researchers' attention to investigate this distinctive phenomenon. Traditionally, research on OSS security has often focused on technical aspects of software development. We argue that these aspects are important, however, technical security practice considering different social aspects of OSS development will assure the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the tool. To mitigate this research gap, in this empirical study, we explore the current security culture in the OSS development phenomenon using a survey instrument with six evaluation dimensions: attitude, behavior, competency, subjective norms, governance, and communication. By exploring the current security culture in OSS communities, we can start to understand the influence of security on participants' security behaviors and decision-making, so that we can make realistic and practical suggestions. In this paper, we present the measurements of security culture adopted in the study and discuss corresponding security issues that need to be addressed in OSS communities.

AB  - With the increasing reliance on information technologies, cloud services and internet as communications media, businesses, public and societal organizations face growing threats from cyberspace and, respectively, demands to protect sensitive data and information they collect, use, and disseminate. This paper elaborates on the key considerations organisations with more limited resources, such as schools, universities, research institutes and public organizations need to take into account in designing and implementing a respective information security policy. We start with a description of context and definition of the scope of information security policy, in particular delineating 'information' and 'cyber' security, and provide an overview of the most prominent frameworks and standards. On that basis we elaborate and structure the main areas of an information security policy, the main implementation challenges, and the need to review and amend the policy in a continuous cycle and comprehensive risk management framework. Depending of the specifics of their work, any school, university, institute and municipality may use this elaboration as a starting point in devising its own information security policy.

TI  - Succession: Measuring Transfer of Code and Developer Productivity
AU  - Mockus, Audris
T3  - ICSE '09
AB  - Code ownership transfer or succession is a crucial ingredient in open source code reuse and in offshoring projects. Measuring succession can help understand factors that affect the success of such transfers and suggest ways to make them more efficient. We propose and evaluate several methods to measure succession based on the chronology and traces of developer activities. Using ten instances of offshoring succession identified through interviews, we find that the best succession measure can accurately pinpoint the most likely mentors. We model the productivity ratio of more than 1000 developer pairs involved in the succession to test conjectures formulated using the organizational socialization theory and find the ratio to decrease for instances of offshoring and for mentors who have worked primarily on a single project or have transferred ownership for their non-primary project code, thus supporting a theory-based conjectures and providing practical suggestions on how to improve succession.

AB  - This position paper discusses the question of incorporating roboethics into the roboticists' thinking about their research. On the one hand, there has been a growing recognition of the need to develop and advance the field of roboethics. On the other hand, for different reasons, a large part of the robotics community has still been reluctant to explicitly address ethical considerations in robotics research. We argue here that in order to facilitate and foster ethical reflection in roboticists' work, roboethics should be seen as a research puzzle. This implies studying rather than only applying specific ethical principles, as well as taking highly creative and pioneering approaches towards emerging ethical challenges.

However, people need to accommodate technical challenges in successful and secure content sharing. In particular, people have to manage access control policies that are both social and technical: deciding what to share and who to share it with, and how to technically effect their decisions. In this paper, we focus on the usability of access control: how people manage file sharing among various groups, organizations, and tasks. We present survey and interview data regarding content sharing and content protection, and discuss the implications for the design of networked collaboration tools.

Available technological controls could be implemented to tighten access and minimize persistent threats but the complete solution of secure software could only be provided by changing the behavior of the people involved. This can be achieved through effective security awareness techniques implemented by individuals because they are, in most cases, the first target for gaining access into the system. This paper highlights the utility of security awareness with the help of recent published work for building more secure software. In addition, areas that need further investigations are identified in the paper.

The other stakeholders' context is not much part of the available e-government research literature. The review identified a total of 126 constructs from 64 studies, which were further classified into five categories, namely, people, technology, policy, economic, and institution. Validation of the relevance of these constructs were done through two qualitative case studies in India. Empirical validation of these constructs in under progress.

T3  - CITC5 '04
AB  - Information Assurance(IA) can be learned by actively being involved in the "doing" process. Students within a university setting have architected, installed and administered a security lab. The value and need for security <i>best practices</i> becomes self-evident, daily, as the security lab services the needs of information technology (IT) courses and research for both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, a need exists to coordinate the administration of the security lab with the ongoing operation of general IT courses and labs. Stability in the infrastructure, lab and research areas can only be achieved by designing good security best practices. A best practice is defined as a process that has performed exceptionally well in industry or the everyday world. Learning to design and implement security <i>best practices</i> is a teaching opportunity for students preparing to be Network Engineers, Security System Engineers or Security Architects. The <i>best practices</i> of the security lab were patterned after IT industry policy concepts that effectively handled change while maintaining a secure and stable infrastructure. The security best practices were developed under the supervision of a student security team and faculty advisor. The use of the IT security lab by undergraduate and graduate students for security projects provided a test of the viability of the security best practices. With the security team and the security policies in place, a working security lab is a realistic learning model in training and educating IT undergraduates and graduates in proper security practices. Furthermore, the experience provides guidance in how to expand security <i>best practices</i> to include the entire educational enterprise of laboratories and IT infrastructure and teaching areas.

TI  - An Ideology of IT Occupational Culture: The ASPIRE Values

AB  - Many have conjectured that people in the IT occupation are different from non-IT business users and that such differences can lead to negative organizational outcomes. This study investigates how to measure these differences by developing a new, expanded theoretical framework of IT occupational culture (ITOC). This framework includes: Artifacts, Values, and Tacit Assumptions. Values form the core of any culture, and a cohesive set of cultural values is termed an "ideology." Using a mixed methodology, research was conducted in two parts to develop and measure an ideology of ITOC. A qualitative investigation based on interview data provided evidence of six core values in the ideology: Autonomy in Decision-Making, Structure in Environment, Precision in Communication, Innovation in Technology, Reverence for Technical Knowledge, and Enjoyment at the Workplace (ASPIRE). The quantitative investigation sought to validate the values and ultimately reduced the number of values to five based on factor analysis of survey data: Autonomy in Decision-Making, Structure/Precision, Innovation in Technology, Reverence for Technical Knowledge, and Enjoyment at the Workplace. IT respondents rated these values significantly higher than non-IT business personnel. Our findings have implications for practitioners and researchers and can provide a path to bridge the gap between IT and business users.

TI  - Review of IS Security Policy Compliance: Toward the Building Blocks of an IS Security Theory
AU  - Balozian, Puzant

T2  - SIGMIS Database
AB  - An understanding of insider threats in information systems (IS) is important to help address one of the dangers lurking within organizations. This article provides a review of the literature on insider compliance (and failure of compliance) with information systems' policies in order to understand the status of IS research regarding negligent and malicious insiders. We begin by defining the terms, developing a new taxonomy of insiders, and then providing a comprehensive review of articles on IS policy compliance for the past 26 years. Grounding the analysis in the literature, we inductively identify four themes to foster Information Security policy compliance among employees. The themes are: 1) IS management philosophy, 2) procedural countermeasures, 3) technical countermeasures, and 4) environmental countermeasures. We propose that future research can draw upon these themes and use them as the building blocks of an indigenous IS security theory.
