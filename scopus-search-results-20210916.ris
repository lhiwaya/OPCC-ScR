AB  - Objective: Data quality (DQ) must be consistently defined in context. The attributes, metadata, and context of longitudinal real-world data (RWD) have not been formalized for quality improvement across the data production and curation life cycle. We sought to complete a literature review on DQ assessment frameworks, indicators and tools for research, public health, service, and quality improvement across the data life cycle. Materials and Methods: The review followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Databases from health, physical and social sciences were used: Cinahl, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, Emcare, PsycINFO, Compendex, and Inspec. Embase was used instead of PubMed (an interface to search MEDLINE) because it includes all MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms used and journals in MEDLINE as well as additional unique journals and conference abstracts. A combined data life cycle and quality framework guided the search of published and gray literature for DQ frameworks, indicators, and tools. At least 2 authors independently identified articles for inclusion and extracted and categorized DQ concepts and constructs. All authors discussed findings iteratively until consensus was reached. Results: The 120 included articles yielded concepts related to contextual (data source, custodian, and user) and technical (interoperability) factors across the data life cycle. Contextual DQ subcategories included relevance, usability, accessibility, timeliness, and trust. Well-tested computable DQ indicators and assessment tools were also found. Conclusions: A DQ assessment framework that covers intrinsic, technical, and contextual categories across the data life cycle enables assessment and management of RWD repositories to ensure fitness for purpose. Balancing security, privacy, and FAIR principles requires trust and reciprocity, transparent governance, and organizational cultures that value good documentation. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the increase in the research field of ethics in artificial intelligence, most efforts have focused on the debate about principles and guidelines for responsible AI, but not enough attention has been given to the “how” of applied ethics. This paper aims to advance the research exploring the gap between practice and principles in AI ethics by identifying how companies are applying those guidelines and principles in practice. Through a qualitative methodology based on 22 semi-structured interviews and two focus groups, the goal of the current study is to understand how companies approach ethical issues related to AI systems. A structured analysis of the transcripts brought out many actual practices and findings, which are presented around the following main research topics: ethics and principles, privacy, explainability, and fairness. The interviewees also raised issues of accountability and governance. Finally, some recommendations are suggested such as developing specific sector regulations, fostering a data-driven organisational culture, considering the algorithm’s complete life cycle, developing and using a specific code of ethics, and providing specific training on ethical issues. Despite some obvious limitations, such as the type and number of companies interviewed, this work identifies real examples and direct priorities to advance the research exploring the gap between practice and principles in AI ethics, with a specific focus on Spanish companies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Information privacy concerns have been rising over a few decades. As per the recent General Data Protection Regulation, organizations need to implement the highest-possible privacy settings by design and default. Following the neo-institutional theory, this study develops a model for understanding the mechanism of information privacy assimilation in Information Technology (IT) organizations. This study treats information privacy as a distinct dimension separate from security. After analyzing a sample survey data of 214 respondents from the IT industry, privacy capability and organizational culture emerged as influencing factors with a statistically significant influence on information privacy assimilation. The findings from this study support the mediating role of senior management participation between the external coercive forces and privacy-related business strategy. Business strategy also plays a mediating role between coercive/normative forces and privacy-related activities within an organization. Here the mimetic forces show a direct influence on privacy-related activities. A positive moderating effect of organizational culture on normative forces and privacy-related activities relationship; and a negative moderating effect of privacy capability on mimetic forces and privacy-related activities relationship are observed. These findings could enable senior managers to respond to institutional pressures by focusing on appropriate factors within an organization for developing effective privacy strategies and actions. This work is an extension of the pilot work that was published in Communications of the Association for Information Systems (CAIS), 2018. The prior work focuses on developing the propositions qualitatively. Building on that, we have formally defined the hypotheses, developed the appropriate survey instrument and collected the primary data which is large enough to do adequate analysis. Adopted a quantitative approach using an extensive sample survey of IT organizations, followed a more rigorous process for data collection, analysis, and discussion of the results. In addition, based on the lessons learned from the pilot study, we have updated the research model and hypotheses with a focus on privacy-related business strategy and activities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) is used to support strategic planning and budgeting, maintenance, repair and operations of organisational assets throughout the asset lifecycle. The purpose of EAM is to improve the assets’ reliability and performance without compromising health, safety and the environment, where Internet of Things (IoT) devices are useful to sense, monitor, respond to, or report asset conditions in real-time with minimum human intervention. Typically, IoT is adopted or integrated into an existing business process in an EAM organisation without reengineering the overall business process. As IoT technologies are usually not custom made for specific business process, adequate governance is critical to the success of IoT adoption. In this paper, adoption of IoT in EAM organisations and its challenges will be discussed from the perspective of data management. Literature reviews and academic case studies are also included to help identify the research gaps and data governance challenges related to adopting IoT technologies into EAM organisations. The factors influencing the IoT adoption will be presented from a technology, organisational, and people perspective. Different categories of challenges have been identified, including standardisation, security and privacy, data quality, organisational culture, business continuity and resilience. The paper concludes with some recommendations to improve IoT adoption in EAM organisations, as well as suggestions for future research directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to learn how and why information and communication technologies (ICTs) are used to initiate, maintain, and dissolve workplace romantic relationships, creating a new model. Workplace romantic relationships are different from traditional romantic relationships in several ways: those in workplace romances may face additional implications following workplace romance disclosure and need to be mindful of how they disclose, they risk damaging gossip that could result in negative professional consequences, and they are influenced by organizational culture. How and why people chose to date those they met at work has important implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach and collecting in-depth qualitative data, we uncovered a model of ICT use in workplace romantic relationships. We also found privacy was a predominant concern in both the initiation and maintenance stages and that communication was generally avoided during dissolution. Technology was used to end many of these relationships including text messages and social networking sites because they are asynchronous and help both parties avoid more direct communication. Theoretical and practical implications for employees, managers, and organizations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - We propose that digital technologies and related data become increasingly prevalent and that, consequently, ethical concerns arise. Looking at four principal stakeholders, we propose corporate digital responsibility (CDR) as a novel concept. We define CDR as the set of shared values and norms guiding an organization's operations with respect to four main processes related to digital technology and data. These processes are the creation of technology and data capture, operation and decision making, inspection and impact assessment, and refinement of technology and data. We expand our discussion by highlighting how to managerially effectuate CDR compliant behavior based on an organizational culture perspective. Our conceptualization unlocks future research opportunities, especially regarding pertinent antecedents and consequences. Managerially, we shed first light on how an organization's shared values and norms regarding CDR can get translated into actionable guidelines for users. This provides grounds for future discussions related to CDR readiness, implementation, and success. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The IT-enabled organisational transformation has been one of the widely studied topics since the introduction of IT in the business process of organisations, regardless of size and industry. Digital transformation, a relatively new but related phenomenon, has recently dominated the debates in the information systems (IS) research domain. Even though there is little disagreement in the role of new digital technologies in enabling innovation and providing a competitive advantage for organisations, researchers and practitioners have also voiced their concerns on the challenges associated with this technology-induced change. Among others, the volume of data collected and stored to make the digital transformation possible has brought the issue of security and privacy to the fore. A systematic literature review of recent studies was conducted to provide an overview of the developments on how organisations attempt to maintain privacy and security while undertaking digital transformation. The results suggest that the adoption of new technologies is contingent on the perception of different stakeholders on how privacy and security are maintained. Besides technical measures in place, organisational culture, organisational structure, HR practices, privacy and security policy, as well as senior leaders' commitment and IT leadership skills are essential to maintain acceptable privacy and security measures that support digital transformation. Implications for research and practice, as well as opportunities for future research, are also presented. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, remote work styles have become the norm. However, these work settings introduce new intricacies in worker behaviors. The overlap between work and home can disrupt performance. The lack of social interaction can affect motivation. This elicits a need to implement novel methods to evaluate and enhance remote worker functioning. The potential to unobtrusively and automatically assess such workers can be fulfilled by social media and ubiquitous technologies. This paper situates recent research in the new context by extending our insights for increased remote interaction and online presence. We present implications for proactive assessment of remote workers by understanding day-level activities, coordination, role awareness, and organizational culture. Additionally, we discuss the ethics of privacy-preserving deployment, employer surveillance, and digital inequity. This paper aims to inspire pervasive technologies for the new future of work. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Learning Analytics is a new field in education whose adoption can bring benefits for teaching and learning processes. However, many higher education institutions may not be ready to start using learning analytics due to challenges such as organizational culture, infrastructure, and privacy. In this context, Maturity Models (MMs) can support institutions to systematize their processes, enabling them to progress successively in the learning analytics adoption. MMs are used in different fields to support the improvement of processes, describing them in terms of maturity levels, and identifying enhancements that could lead an organization to higher levels of such maturity. Thus, this paper presents an outline of a MM for Learning Analytics adoption in higher education institutions, describing its levels and areas, together with its development methodology. © 2020 IEEE.

Further development of existing initiatives requires iterative processes of developing, implementing and evaluating improvements to current practice. This case study provides insight into the process of improving an existing integrated care initiative in the Netherlands. Using a participatory approach, researchers and local stakeholders collaborated to develop and implement activities to further improve collaboration between health and social care professionals. Improvement activities included interprofessional meetings focussing on reflection and mutual learning and workplace visits. Researchers evaluated the improvement process, using data triangulation of multiple qualitative and quantitative data sources. According to participating professionals, the improvement activities improved their communication and collaboration by establishing mutual understanding and trust. Enabling factors included the safe and informal setting in which the meetings took place and the personal relationships they developed during the project. Different organisational cultures and interests and a lack of ownership and accountability among managers hindered the improvement process, whereas issues such as staff shortages, time constraints and privacy regulations made it difficult to implement improvements on a larger scale. Still, the participatory approach encouraged the development of partnerships and shared goals on the level of both managers and professionals. This case study highlights that improving communication between professionals is an important first step in improving integrated care. In addition, it shows that a participatory approach, in which improvements are co-created and tailored to local priorities and needs, can help in the development of shared goals and trust between stakeholders with different perspectives. However, stakeholders' willingness and ability to participate in such an improvement process is challenged by many factors. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to take cognisance of the work–life balance (WLB) challenges facing working women in Oman, make a review of the family-friendly policies (FFPs), related provisions in labour laws of various nations, and identify and suggest some FFP-based solutions for attracting women to private sector jobs. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, desk research was used to review the labour laws of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and some pioneering countries known for their workplace policies using the major electronic databases and official websites. An exploratory approach was used to understand the lived experience of participants using 46 in-depth interviews. The data were analysed and the findings were explained and contextualised in terms of the Arab culture, wider social processes and consequences related to WLB. Findings: The interviews revealed that the majority of women in the private sector are not fully aware of the labour laws and FFPs, and are not satisfied with the existing policies, as they do not provide the right WLB. Women in the private sector demand flexible working hours, privacy at work, reduced work hours and certain other benefits akin to the government sector. Omani Labour Law needs a review of FFPs in line with the best global practices and Oman’s diversification initiatives. The provision, awareness and implementation of FFPs in the workplace are necessary to attract Omani women to private sector jobs. Research limitations/implications: This research focusses on Oman in particular and GCC countries in general in its coverage of Omani women workers. The outcomes would be important for the specific segment but would have limited potential to generalise. Practical implications: The study of WLB and FFPs is of interest for both academia and industry globally. In its strategic vision 2040, Oman aims to encourage, support and develop the private sector to drive the national economy. To retain and boost the socio-economic development in the post-oil economy, the success of the private sector will depend on the participation of the Omani workforce. The role of working Omani women will be pivotal, for they form a substantial part of the skilled human resources inventory. Social implications: Women working in Oman are influenced by labour laws, organisational culture, traditional attitudes and societal values and influences. The voices of women working in the private sector indicate a great need to create awareness of existing policies, ensure their compliance and devise additional workplace policies to enable women to contribute to the labour market. Originality/value: There is a dearth of studies examining work policies and employment of women in the context of Oman in particular and the GCC Countries in general. Even in the extant literature, the sectoral imbalance between the government and private sector has not been explored from the perspective of WLB and FFPs. This study presents a unique approach and findings in this regard. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The growing diffusion of software in society and its influence on people demands from its creators that their work carefully considers human values such as transparency, social responsibility, and equality. But how do software practitioners address human values in software engineering practice&#x2019; We interviewed 31 software practitioners from two organizations, each having a strong values framework, with the aim to understand: (a) practitioners&#x2019; perceptions of human values and their role in software engineering; (b)practices that practitioners use to address human values in software; and (c) challenges they face during this process. We report our findings from two contrasting case studies on how practitioners &#x201C;engineer&#x201D; values in their unique organizational settings. We found evidence that organizational culture significantly contributes to how values are addressed in software. We summarize recommendations from the practitioners to support proactive engineering of values-conscious software. IEEE

AB  - Purpose: Advances in electronic performance monitoring (EPM) have raised employees’ concerns regarding the invasion of privacy and erosion of trust. On the other hand, EPM promises to improve performance and processes. This paper aims to focus on how the alignment of EPM design and organizational culture through effective organizational mechanisms can address privacy concerns, and, hence, positively affect employees’ perception toward technology. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a theoretical lens extending two conceptual frameworks, a qualitative approach was used to analyze interview data collected from a comparative case study of two organizations in the USA and Qatar within the oil and gas sector. These two contexts were selected to emphasize the cross-cultural and organizational differences in employees’ acceptance of EPM. Findings: The study revealed that national and corporate cultures affected employees’ perception and acceptance of monitoring in both countries. Because of diversity, though EPM was better accepted in Qatar, as they are an easy way to enforce standardization and to push employees to adapt to a dominating corporate culture. Conversely, in the USA where culture is more innovation-oriented, organizational mechanisms shifted the perceptions of EPM to being mean to obtain feedback rather than to impose standards. Research limitations/implications: This qualitative study is based on a descriptive comparative case study of two organizations with two cultural contexts. The limited sample size and cross-sectional nature of data may need to be extended to a larger cultural scope that is observed over a longer period to safely generalize the findings. Practical implications: Decision-makers in multinational corporations with different cultural backgrounds may benefit of this study’s outcomes, as it emphasizes the importance of the fit between EPM designs and the cultural settings. Furthermore, organizations aiming to conduct analytics on EPM data have to justify and prove its benefits to employees to facilitate acceptance. Social implications: The study shows that employees in Qatar have a different cultural frame of reference in their perception of fairness and ethics than their counterparts in the USA because of changes in the meaning of social relations, personal goals and behavioral norms. Originality/value: The originality of this study lays in its empirical validation of a composite framework examining both national and corporate cultures on employees’ reactions to EPM systems. It also proves the critical importance of organizational mechanisms to align the EPM design with the organization cultural settings. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is fundamental for organizational success as a tool to accumulate, store, and protect organizational critical and big data. However, very often, these systems fail for various reasons, and there are many high profile examples of ERP systems implementation. This study gathers evidence on the influence on nepotism, as a component of organizational culture, on the human element of ERP systems implementation success. We conducted our study by surveying 69 small to medium firms in Lebanon. Data was collected using questionnaires. Data analysis adopted variance-based structural equation modelling technique. The results of the study indicate that nepotism significantly impacts the human resources component of ERP systems implementation success. Such systems can be more effectively implemented in firms with an organizational culture that does not nurture nepotism. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Firms use Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), as a component of accounting information systems, to define and facilitate the exchange of sensitive and confidential big financial data, namely, financial reports of use to shareholders, stakeholders, competitors and public users. However, still, many companies have not, yet, successfully adopted XBRL despite its foreseen competitive advantages. Different factors affect the successful adoption of XBRL. The human factor, as a component of organizational culture, is deemed to impact the successful adoption of XBRL. Based on an in-depth literature review, and analysis of surveys collected from 78 small to medium-sized firms in Lebanon, using variance-based structural equation model analysis, the impact of human factors on XBRL successful adoption is defined. Results identified the impact of human factors impact on the successful adoption of XBRL by firms seeking to adopt the lateral mandatory financial reporting standards. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The adoption of accounting information systems (AIS) is fundamental for organizational success as it improves accumulation, management, and control of big organizational data. However, such systems often fail, causing significant operational problems and financial losses. This study gathers evidence on the impact of organizational culture on the internal controls components of accounting information systems (AIS). We conducted this study by surveying 72 small to medium enterprises in the city of Beirut, Lebanon. Data analysis adopted a partial least squares regression. The results of the study indicate that organizational cultural traits significantly influence the internal controls components of accounting information systems, and thus, such systems can be more successful in firms with supporting organizational cultural traits. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Justice facilities such as jails are complex adaptive systems. They are people-driven, whether by the organizational culture of those that operate them, or by inmate culture. The development of organizational culture is organic and based on buy-in at all levels, or the lack thereof. Organizational culture evolves, including in response to attempted interventions from within or without. Physical and electronic security’s relationship to detention operations and detainee supervision involves similar dynamics. In this paper, we explore jail operations. We model human use of a housing unit and associated support spaces via discrete-event simulation. We simulate this system to understand the capacity and limits on human use of building spaces. We explore how this sociotechnical system responds when stressed. We thereby validate the design within limits that correspond to planned operational capacity. The goal of the research is to design spaces and environments that support improved outcomes via improvements in organizational culture. We introduce the specifics of jail operations via this model while exploring the full range of applications for this type of simulation in the built environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Telepsychiatry is effective and has generated hope and promise for improved access and enhanced quality of care with reasonable cost containment. Clinicians and organizations are informed about clinical, technological, and administrative telepsychiatric barriers via guidelines, but there are many practical patient and clinician factors that have slowed implementation and undermined sustainability. Literature describing barriers to use of telepsychiatry was reviewed. PubMed search terms with date limits from January 1, 1959, to April 25, 2019, included telepsychiatry, telemedicine, telemental health, videoconferencing, video based, Internet, synchronous, real-time, two-way, limitations, restrictions, barriers, obstacles, challenges, issues, implementation, utilization, adoption, perspectives, perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, willingness, acceptability, feasibility, culture/cultural, outcomes, satisfaction, quality, effectiveness, and efficacy. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of relevance. Barriers are described from both patient and clinicians' perspectives. Patients and clinicians are largely satisfied with telepsychiatry, but concerns about establishing rapport, privacy, safety, and technology limitations have slowed acceptance of telepsychiatry. Clinicians are also concerned about reimbursement/financial, legal/regulatory, licensure/credentialing, and education/learning issues. These issues point to system and policy concerns, which, in combination with other administrative concerns, raise questions about system design/workflow, efficiency of clinical care, and changing organizational culture. Although telepsychiatry service is convenient for patients, the many barriers from clinicians’ perspectives are concerning, because they serve as gatekeepers for implementation and sustainability of telepsychiatry services. This suggests that solutions to overcome barriers must start by addressing the concerns of clinicians and enhancing clinical workflow. © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

AB  - This study examines the extent to which business performance in global enterprises can be influenced by three key factors in the current dynamic, socio-economic context. These are: (1) an open organisational culture derived from an open-mindedness attitude, (2) an organisation's investments in innovation in environmentally friendly and health-conscious products and services, and (3) customers' perception of risk of information security and privacy concerns derived from their engagement with the organisation and its products and services. Taking Apple as the basis for our study, an empirical investigation of 161 of its customers from a variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, our results indicate that a culture of open mindedness relates, indirectly and though environmental product innovation, to the way the firm addresses the privacy concerns of end users. This, in turn, helps addressing the privacy concerns of the customer base and, simultaneously improves firms' performance, offering a mix-blended source of strategic advantage. Based on a leading innovation company in the U.S. and globally, and one of the most important names in the technology industry, lessons can be learned from our study both for further theoretical developments and for management practice in a variety of knowledge-intensive, global enterprises. © 2019

AB  - Background: Nurses’ service behaviors have critical implications for hospitals. However, few studies had adequate ethical considerations of service behaviors and accounted for how organizational or individual antecedents can induce nurses to engage in service behaviors. In addition, they mainly focused on the one side of role-prescribed or extra-role service behavior. Objective: This study aims to explore the chained mediation effect of ethical climate and moral sensitivity on the relationship between organizational ethical leadership and nurses’ service behaviors and to examine the relationship, from a comparative view, of the role-prescribed service behavior and extra-role service behavior. Methods: In all, 476 nurses from three tertiary hospitals were investigated with the Ethical Leadership Scale, Ethical Climate Scale, Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire and Service Behavior Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was adopted to analyze the data. SPSS and Mplus statistical software was used in the data analysis. Ethical considerations: Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee at School of Nursing, Hebei Medical University. Data privacy and confidentiality were maintained and assured by obtaining subjects’ informed consent to participate in the research before data collection. Results: The effects of ethical leadership on nurses’ service behaviors are mediated by two variables in turn: ethical climate and nurses’ moral sensitivity. Ethical climate and moral sensitivity partially mediated the relationship between ethical leadership and nurses’ role-prescribed service behavior and fully mediated the relationship between ethical leadership and nurses’ extra-role service behavior. Conclusion: Organizational ethical leadership positively affected ethical climate, which positively affected nurses’ moral sensitivity and affected both their role-prescribed service behavior and extra-role service behavior. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Increasing the prevalence of digital technologies and related data, and that ethical concerns arise as a result. Looking at four main stakeholders and propose a novel concept in the field of corporate digital responsibility (CDR). Under this paper CDR is defines as the set of shared values and standards which guide the operations of an organization in relation to four main processes related to digital technology and data. Such methods are the creation of technology and data collection, activity and decision-making, review and effect evaluation, and technology and data refining. Discussion is expanded our by highlighting how to manage behavior that is compliant with CDR based on a perspective of organizational culture. Our conceptualization opens possibilities for future research, particularly with regard to specific contexts and implications. Managingly, we shed first light on how the shared values and standards of an organization regarding CDR can be translated into user-friendly guidelines. It offers foundations for future discussions on planning, deployment and progress of CDRs. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: To identify affected family members’ (AFMs) experiences of barriers and facilitators to informal and formal help-seeking for themselves and on behalf of a close relative with alcohol and other drug (AOD) misuse. Methods: Qualitative study, informed by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Semi-structured, audio-recorded, telephone interviews were used to collect data from 31 AFMs. Results: AFMs experienced several overlapping and at times competing help-seeking obstacles and enablers in accessing informal and formal support for themselves and on behalf of their relative with AOD misuse, and these are reflected in two themes and associated sub-themes: barriers to help-seeking and facilitators to help-seeking. Five help-seeking barriers were abstracted from the data: Stigma discourages help-seeking, Difficulty locating informal and formal support services, Previous negative AOD service help-seeking experiences deter subsequent help-seeking, Hopelessness inhibits help-seeking, and Feeling undervalued as an AFM. Three help-seeking facilitators were abstracted from the data: Previous positive help-seeking experiences increase future help-seeking, Overcoming shame and isolation and being open with trusted significant others, and Persevering in help-seeking. Conclusions: AFMs who access informal and formal help sources for themselves, and on behalf of their relative, are more likely to sustain their important support-giving role. Measures to strengthen AFMs’ capacity and willingness to support their relative should be founded on an understanding of factors that affect their own help-seeking in addition to those encountered when help-seeking on behalf of their relative. Our findings have implications for the visibility of AOD services and informal support groups on the Internet, organisational culture of some AOD services, valuing the contributions of AFMs, and protecting AFMs and their relatives’ privacy. Our findings also have implications for reducing public stigma of AOD misuse, changing some AFMs’ scepticism about treatment outcomes, and reinforcing and enhancing AFMs’ skills in persevering with help-seeking. © 2018

AB  - Background: In the healthcare sector, a comprehensive safety culture includes both patient care-related and occupational aspects. In recent years, healthcare studies have demonstrated diverse relationships between aspects of psychosocial working conditions, occupational, and patient safety culture. The aim of this study was to consider and test relevant predictors for staff’s perceptions of occupational and patient safety cultures in hospitals and whether there are shared predictors. From two German university hospitals, 381 physicians and 567 nurses completed a questionnaire on psychosocial working conditions, occupational, and patient safety culture. Two regression models with predictors for occupational and patient safety culture were conceptually developed and empirically tested. In the Occupational Safety Culture model, job satisfaction (β = 0.26, p ≤ 0.001), work-privacy conflict (β = −0.19, p ≤ 0.001), and patient-related burnout (β = −0.20, p ≤ 0.001) were identified as central predictors. Important predictors in the Patient Safety Culture model were management support for patient safety (β = 0.24, p ≤ 0.001), supervisor support for patient safety (β = 0.18, p ≤ 0.001), and staffing (β = 0.21, p ≤ 0.001). The two models mainly resulted in different predictors. However, job satisfaction and leadership seem to play an important role in both models and can be used in the development of a comprehensive management of occupational and patient safety culture. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Measuring mistreatment and quality of care during childbirth is important in promoting respectful maternity care. We describe these dimensions throughout the birthing process from admission, delivery and immediate postpartum care. We observed 677 client–provider interactions and conducted 13 facility assessments in Kenya. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression model to illustrate how mistreatment and clinical process of care vary through the birthing process. During admission, the prevalence of verbal abuse was 18%, lack of informed consent 59%, and lack of privacy 67%. Women with higher parity were more likely to be verbally abused [AOR: 1.69; (95% CI 1.03,2.77)]. During delivery, low levels of verbal and physical abuse were observed, but lack of privacy and unhygienic practices were prevalent during delivery and postpartum (>65%). Women were less likely to be verbally abused [AOR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.78, 0.99)] or experience unhygienic practices, [AOR: 0.87 (95% CI 0.78, 0.97)] in better-equipped facilities. During admission, providers were observed creating rapport (52%), taking medical history (82%), conducting physical assessments (5%). Women’s likelihood to receive a physical assessment increased with higher infrastructural scores during admission [AOR: 2.52; (95% CI 2.03, 3.21)] and immediately postpartum [AOR 2.18; (95% CI 1.24, 3.82)]. Night-time deliveries were associated with lower likelihood of physical assessment and rapport creation [AOR; 0.58; (95% CI 0.41,0.86)]. The variability of mistreatment and clinical quality of maternity along the birthing process suggests health system drivers that influence provider behaviour and health facility environment should be considered for quality improvement and reduction of mistreatment. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Disrespect and abuse of patients, especially birthing women, does occur in the health sector. This is a violation of women’s fundamental human rights and can be viewed as a consequence of women’s lives not being valued by larger social, economic and political structures. Here we demonstrate how such disrespect and abuse is enacted at an interpersonal level across the continuum of care in Tanzania. We describe how and why women’s exposure to disrespect and abuse should be seen as a symptom of structural violence. Detailed narratives were developed based on interviews and observations of 14 rural women’s interactions with health providers from their first antenatal visit until after birth. Narratives were based on observation of 25 antenatal visits, 3 births and 92 in-depth interviews with the same women. All women were exposed to non-supportive care during pregnancy and birth including psychological abuse, physical abuse, abandonment and privacy violations. Systemic gender inequality renders women excessively vulnerable to abuse, expressed as a normalisation of abuse in society. Health institutions reflect and reinforce dominant social processes and normalisation of non-supportive care is symptomatic of an institutional culture of care that has become dehumanised. Health providers may act disrespectfully because they are placed in a powerful position, holding authority over their patients. However, they are themselves also victims of continuous health system challenges and poor working conditions. Preventing disrespect and abuse during antenatal care and childbirth requires attention for structural inequalities that foster conditions that make mistreatment of vulnerable women possible. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper draws on findings from a qualitative study of two government hospitals in Mumbai, India, which aimed to provide a better understanding of the institutional drivers of disrespect and abuse (D&A) in childbirth. The paper describes the structural context, in which government hospital providers can exercise considerable power over patients, yet may be themselves vulnerable to violence and external influence. Decisions that affect care are made by a bureaucracy, which does not perceive problems with the same intensity as providers who are directly attending to patients. Within this context, while contrasting organisational cultures had evolved at the two hospitals, both were characterised by social/professional inequality and hierarchical functioning, and marginalising women. This context generates invisible pressures on subordinate staff, and creates interpersonal conflicts and ambiguity in the division of roles and responsibilities that manifest in individual actions of D&A. Services are organised around the internal logic of the institution, rather than being centred on women. This results in conditions that violate women's privacy, and disregards their choice and consent. The structural environment of resource constraints, poor management and bureaucratic decision-making leads to precarious situations, endangering women’s safety. With the institution's functioning based on hierarchies and authority, rather than adherence to universal standards or established protocols, irrational, harmful practices endorsed by senior staff are institutionalised and reproduced. A deeper focus on organisational culture, embedded in the discourse of D&A, would help to evolve effective strategies to address D&A as systemic problems. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - To be prepared for the ‘Industry 4.0’-era, we propose a hierarchical framework comprising four tangible layers, which is designed to vertically integrate inter-organizational value networks, engineering value chain, manufacturing factories, etc. The conceptual framework allows us to efficiently implement a flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transnational information sharing among security agencies in the European Union and beyond has grown considerably more important over the past decades. Centralised databases and numerous formal and informal networks now facilitate cooperation and information sharing. However, sharing intelligence may not only conflict with the protection of fundamental rights (data protection/privacy; presumption of innocence), but also with the organisational culture of institutions that are built upon secrecy. Police agencies often keep knowledge about individual cases and their strategies secret as long as possible. Intelligence services build their work and strategies upon secrecy even more. This paper analyses the variations of secrecy that can be observed for police agencies and secret services, and the relationship between information sharing among security agencies, secrecy, trust, transparency and accountability. In a normative perspective, the paper explores answers to the questions of how secret the work of security agencies should be in democratic rule of law systems and how accountability can be improved without making these institutions work less effectively. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show that virtual mirroring-based learning allows members of an organization to see how they communicate with others in a visual way, by applying principles of “social quantum physics” (empathy, entanglement, reflect, reboot), to become better communicators and build a shared “DNA” within their organization. Design/methodology/approach: E-mail based social network analysis creates virtual maps of communication – social landscapes – of organizations, similar to Google Maps, which creates geographical maps of a person’s surroundings. Findings: Applying virtual mirroring-based learning at various mulitnational firms has significantly increased their organizational efficiency and performance, for instance increasing customer satisfaction by 18 per cent in a large services organization, increasing retention, making sales forecasts, and improving call center employee satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: To address concerns of individual privacy, the guiding principle is to give individual information to the individual and provide aggregated anonymized information to management. Originality/value: Virtual mirroring-based learning offers a unique way of creating collective awareness within an organization by empowering the individual to take corrective action aligned with collective action, and improves their own communication behavior through analyzing and visualizing their e-mail archive in novel ways, while giving strategic insight to management and improving organizational culture. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This poster analyzes challenges to planning, deploying, and maintaining different types of library services in the cloud. We apply grounded theory principles to analyze 75 articles authored by library administrators, librarians with IT expertise, IT professionals, cybersecurity experts, and business consultants engaged in planning, deploying, and maintaining library services in the cloud. Data analysis reveals that a majority of the past literature reports challenges to implementing Software as a Service (SaaS) in libraries. The seven key areas critical to the successful implementation of SaaS in libraries are related to: (1) data, (2) authentication and privacy of patrons, (3) skills and knowledge of library staff and organizational culture, (4) IT infrastructure, (5) features of services, (6) fixed and operational costs associated with data and technology, and (7) policies and contracts. Data issues like access, storage, ownership, curation, security, confidentiality, loss, migration, and redundancy seem to have the most influence on SaaS deployment in libraries. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Many companies move from open-plan offices (OPO) to activity-based workplaces (ABWs). However, few studies examine the benefits and drawbacks following such a change. The aim of this study was to explore how physical conditions, office use, communication, privacy, territoriality, satisfaction and perceived performance change following a company’s relocation from an OPO to an ABW. A mixed methods approach included pre- and post-relocation questionnaires and post-relocation focus groups, individual interviews and observations. The questionnaires enabled comparisons over time (n = 34) and broader analyses based on retrospective ratings of perceived change (n = 66). Results showed that satisfaction with auditory privacy, background noise, air quality, outdoor view and aesthetics increased significantly after relocation. Negative outcomes, such as lack of communication within teams, were perceived as being due to the high people-to-workstation ratio and lack of rules. Overall satisfaction with the physical work environment increased in the ABW compared to the OPO. Perceived performance did not change significantly. Practitioner Summary: Activity-based workplaces (ABWs) are commonly implemented although their effects on performance and well-being are unclear. This case study gives advice to stakeholders involved in office planning. Despite shortcomings with the people-to-workstation ratio and rules, employees showed improved satisfaction with auditory privacy and aesthetics in the ABW compared with the previous open-plan office. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The evolution of information systems and the growth in the use of the Internet and social networks has caused an explosion in the amount of available data relevant to the activities of the companies. Therefore, the treatment of these available data is vital to support operational, tactical and strategic decisions. This paper aims to present the concept of big data and the main technologies that support the analysis of large data volumes. The potential of big data is explored considering nine sectors of activity, such as financial, retail, healthcare, transports, agriculture, energy, manufacturing, public, and media and entertainment. In addition, the main current opportunities, vulnerabilities and privacy challenges of big data are discussed. It was possible to conclude that despite the potential for using the big data to grow in the previously identified areas, there are still some challenges that need to be considered and mitigated, namely the privacy of information, the existence of qualified human resources to work with Big Data and the promotion of a data-driven organizational culture. © 2018, Ital publication.

AB  - Privacy by design (PbD) is a policy measure that guides software developers to apply inherent solutions to achieve better privacy protection. For PbD to be a viable option, it is important to understand developers’ perceptions, interpretation and practices as to informational privacy (or data protection). To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 27 developers from different domains, who practice software design. Grounded analysis of the data revealed an interplay between several different forces affecting the way in which developers handle privacy concerns. Borrowing the schema of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we classified and analyzed the cognitive, organizational and behavioral factors that play a role in developers’ privacy decision making. Our findings indicate that developers use the vocabulary of data security to approach privacy challenges, and that this vocabulary limits their perceptions of privacy mainly to third-party threats coming from outside of the organization; that organizational privacy climate is a powerful means for organizations to guide developers toward particular practices of privacy; and that software architectural patterns frame privacy solutions that are used throughout the development process, possibly explaining developers’ preference of policy-based solutions to architectural solutions. Further, we show, through the use of the SCT schema for framing the findings of this study, how a theoretical model of the factors that influence developers’ privacy practices can be conceptualized and used as a guide for future research toward effective implementation of PbD. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The physical space in which work is undertaken plays a key role in facilitating or inhibiting creativity among workers. The design of the workspace can inspire workers to be creative, facilitate the sharing of knowledge, and support social interaction, which is so important to the creative process. Equally, the workspace design can have an inhibitive effect by isolating individuals, being physically oppressive and being overly prescriptive in usage. This chapter begins by exploring the history of the office and how the design of the physical space has changed over the last century as the nature of work and organizational cultures have changed. Following this discussion, focus is given to the knowledge workers that occupy such physical spaces today and the different needs that they have from the office to fulfil their role. The chapter concludes by suggesting how to strike the balance between privacy and collaboration through the workspace design in order to meet the needs of all types of knowledge workers and the requirements of the creativity process. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Recent advances in electronic performance monitoring (EPM) have raised employee concerns regarding invasion of privacy and the erosion of trust. However, the use of data analytics on the EPM data promises to improve organizational and employee performance. Aligning the design of the EPM system with the organizational culture and establishing effective organizational mechanisms to address concerns will positively affect how employees perceive the technology. Data collected from two organizations in the US and in Qatar within the oil and gas sector reveals organizational efforts to promote the image of EPM as an employee-empowering technology, providing objective feedback to achieve individual and organizational goals. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the positive effect of organizational culture on knowledge management (KM) by clarifying the mediating effect of job satisfaction on the banking sector in Jordan. The study was conducted on Jordanian banks to develop the organizational culture concept to be reflected in the bank activities. The population of this study consists of junior and senior customer service and administrative employees working at Jordanian banks in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this research is purposive one because the research cannot get a list containing names of customer service employees for privacy reasons. Various statistical tests were employed to test the research hypotheses. The study utilized two statistical packages – Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and SPSS-AMOS – for analyzing the data. Findings: The development of organizational culture at banks in Jordan is still not stable and efficient. This may be affected by the management style and teamwork spirit in Jordan and other factors related to bank culture and how it will be reflected in customer service. The creation and application of KM at banks in Jordan is still modest. Knowledge is mainly shared internally within the bank with little efforts dedicated to soliciting knowledge from the external environment including customers. The job satisfaction at banks in Jordan is still modest. Originality/value: The purpose of this study is to investigate how the organizational culture can improve job satisfaction for efficient work knowledge. The relationship between organizational culture and KM of organizational members is developed and analyzed herein by proposing a mediating role of job satisfaction. Few research papers have focused on job satisfaction and its mechanism contributing to individual effectiveness in the Jordanian market, and many ignored the benefits of KM and value of culture in many sectors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Office layout features and organizational culture have independently been shown to influence employee job satisfaction; however, little is known about whether office layout influences organizational culture. This study had two aims. The first was to investigate the association between office layout and organizational culture. The second was to investigate whether organizational culture mediates the relationship between office layout and job satisfaction. A total of 202 Australian workers completed an online survey. Structural equation modelling revealed that office layout features were significantly and positively associated with ratings of organizational culture. Additionally, culture ratings were shown to mediate the relationship between the office layout features and job satisfaction. These findings suggest that perceptions of office layout can influence employees’ perceptions of the organizational culture and important employee attitudes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous articles in this column have studied how technical service units provide value to their organizations. Those articles explored ways in which cataloging units provide service to libraries and how to develop and market those services to communicate their value. This article builds on this previous work by studying assessment approaches broadly for departments like technical services that provide “building block” or supporting services for user-facing organizations like libraries. The author proposes a framework for identifying an assessment outcome and connecting it back to a specific research question and design (i.e., intended outcome, assessment question[s], data gathering approach, data gathering method, data analysis method). Issues around question design, privacy, and organizational culture are discussed as factors to consider in the assessment of building-block services. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2017 Erik T.

AB  - Objectives To investigate different professionals' (nurse anaesthetists', anaesthesiologists', and postanaesthesia care unit nurses') descriptions of and reflections on the postoperative handover. Design A focus group interview study with a descriptive design using qualitative content analysis of transcripts. Setting One anaesthetic clinic at two hospitals in Sweden. Participants Six focus groups with 23 healthcare professionals involved in postoperative handovers. Each group was homogeneous regarding participant profession, resulting in two groups per profession: nurse anaesthetists (n=8), anaesthesiologists (n=7) and postanaesthesia care unit nurses (n=8). Results Patterns and five categories emerged: (1) having different temporal foci during handover, (2) insecurity when information is transferred from one team to another, (3) striving to ensure quality of the handover, (4) weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the bedside handover and (5) having different perspectives on the transfer of responsibility. The professionals' perceptions of the postoperative handover differed with regard to temporal foci and transfer of responsibility. All professional groups were insecure about having all information needed to ensure the quality of care. They strived to ensure quality of the handover by: Focusing on matters that deviated from the normal course of events, aiding memory through structure and written information and cooperating within and between teams. They reported that the bedside handover enhances their control of the patient but also that it could threaten the patient's privacy and that frequent interruptions could be disturbing. Conclusions The present findings revealed variations in different professionals' views on the postoperative handover. Healthcare interventions are needed to minimise the gap between professionals' perceptions and practices and to achieve a shared understanding of postoperative handover. Furthermore, to ensure high-quality and safe care, stakeholders/decision makers need to pay attention to the environment and infrastructure in postanaesthesia care. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

AB  - A sample of 103 full-time employees from various organizations and industries completed an online, open-ended survey to explore and understand the decisions people make to manage their private disclosures at work. Communication privacy management theory was used to understand the management of private information. Results indicate that core and catalyst criteria motivate people to reveal/conceal at work, such as boundary maintenance based on organizational culture, relational considerations, a desire for feedback, and risk/benefit considerations. People also used implicit/explicit rules, reiteration of privacy rules, and retaliation to limit and respond to turbulence. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Increasingly, big data is viewed as the most strategic resource of the 21st century, similar in importance to gold and oil. While sitting on these vast pools of data, many organizations are simply not ready to take advantage of this new strategic resource. Embracing big data requires addressing a number of barriers that fall into the domains of technology, people, and organization. A holistic, socio-technical approach is required to overcome these barriers. This article introduces the specific tactics we recommend for addressing big data barriers, which involve changes to technology infrastructure, a focus on privacy, promotion of big data and analytic skills development, and the creation of a clear organizational vision related to big data. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

AB  - Background: Healthcare organizations are now challenged to retain nurses’ generation and understand why they are leaving their nursing career prematurely. Acquiring knowledge about the effect of ethical work climate and level of perceived organizational support can help organizational leaders to deal effectively with dysfunctional behaviors and make a difference in enhancing nurses’ dedication, commitment, satisfaction, and loyalty to their organization. Purpose: This study aims to determine the relationship between ethical work climate, and perceived organizational support and nurses’ organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intention. Methods: A descriptive correlational research design was conducted in all inpatient care units at three major hospitals affiliated to different health sectors at Alexandria governorate. All nurses working in these previous hospitals were included in the study (N = 500). Ethical Climate Questionnaire, Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, Index of Job Satisfaction, and Intention to Turnover scale were used to measure study variables. Ethical considerations: Approval was obtained from Ethics Committee at Faculty of Nursing, Alexandria University. Privacy and confidentiality of data were maintained and assured by obtaining subjects’ informed consent to participate in the research before data collection. Findings: The result revealed positive significant correlations between nurses’ perception of overall ethical work climate and each of perceived organizational support, commitment, as well as their job satisfaction. However, negative significant correlations were found between nurses’ turnover intention and each of these variables. Also, approximately 33% of the explained variance of turnover intention is accounted by ethical work climate, organizational support, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction, and these variables independently contributed significantly in the prediction of turnover intention. Recommendation: Strategies to foster and enhance ethical and supportive work climates as well as job-related benefits are considered significant factors in increasing nurses’ commitment and satisfaction and decreasing their turnover intention. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - New technologies continuously challenge people's information privacy, while privacy protection practices, such as Privacy-by-Design, did not become widespread engineering practices. The difficulty of designing privacy-preserving information systems highlights the need for studying developers' privacy decision-making processes, as the developers' communities are well coordinated and they are the ones who can promote or hinder privacy in the systems they design. We conducted an online survey (n=101), to understand the effectors on developers' professional privacy attitudes and practices. We investigate whether developer's privacy decision-making is shaped by several factors, including organizational (organizational privacy climate, business and legal contexts), professional (privacy knowledge) and personal (personal perceived privacy).

AB  - Due to the rise of social media, many companies have started to implement enterprise social networks (ESNs). Compared to existing systems supporting communication and collaboration in organisations, ESNs can foster employees' productivity and innovativeness by making previously invisible communication among employees visible. However, this visibility can prevent employees from disclosing information within ESNs. As the success of ESNs depends on users' contributions, it is crucial to understand which factors influence employees' behaviour in this regard. In this research, we investigate the role of organisational culture in fostering employees' trusting and mitigating their risk beliefs, two factors we transfer from research on Online Social Networks (OSNs) and hypothesize to be highly relevant for information disclosure in ESNs. Based on data obtained from 282 employees, we find support for our hypotheses and illustrate that group and development culture significantly affect employees' trusting and risk beliefs, and their willingness to disclose information. Our results imply that organisations should carefully assess employees' trusting and risk beliefs as well as their culture to account for possible obstacles preventing employees' information disclosure. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

AB  - Design is a way of thinking where adaptability and simplicity carry value for the end-user. Any interactions with technologies and systems need to be cognitively adapted to be intuitive, culturally aligned and trustworthy. The emotional output of successful interaction with valuable design is a series of moments of serendipity for the user. Successful design feels right. In order to create such moments, the designer needs to not only emphasize with the users, but also know the culture surrounding the user, and the cognitive apparatus applied by the user. Design thinking characterized by prospective empathy with users will take the form of a dynamic discipline of prototyping, and can only take place in a culture with a tolerance for failure. The best means for creating efficient user-centered design and future user interactions will be by developing a dynamic and flexible organizational culture with as little internal competition as possible. Designers feeling or experiencing emotional threats will no longer have the right emotional resources to fully empathize with the end-user and any design will deteriorate as a result, along with trust (see Chapter 19 for an introduction to organizational culture fostering design thinking). Furthermore, in digitized and advanced big-data analytics, trust is inevitably rooted in the functionality of the design. Unless privacy and data handling is aligned to the individual user, in a targeted culture, product demand will suffer as a function of violation of privacy. © Marika Lüders, Tor W.

AB  - Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is an emerging trend that is being adopted by an increasing number of organisations due to the benefits it provides in terms of cost efficiency, employee productivity, and staff morale. However, organisations who could benefit from implementing BYOD remain sceptical, due to the increasing threats and vulnerabilities introduced by mobile technology, which are amplified due to the human element (insider threats, non-security savvy employees). In this context, this paper investigates the application of human factor techniques to the BYOD scheme of an anonymised, real-life organisation (referred to as “Globex”). Questionnaires and Interactive Management are two Human Factor methods used in this case study to help determine areas for improvement. Results from the experiment highlight an issue with employee satisfaction towards their employers’ BYOD scheme, which could negatively impact their organisational culture. The paper concludes with recommendations for additional information within the BYOD policy and the review of reimbursement eligibility and entitlements. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - The concept of Privacy by Design is rooted in systems engineering. Yet, it is the legal framework of global privacy that gives new color to this concept as applied to Big Data. Increasingly, the long arm of the law is reaching into Big Data, but it is not simply by matter of regulatory enforcement or civil legal developments that Privacy by Design (PbD) is being thrust into the spotlight once more. Given that Big Data is considered miniscule in contrast to future data environments,1 PbD is simply the right thing to do. This paper aims to explore the origin of PbD, the current and future state of Big Data and regulatory enforcement, and the methodology of PbD applied to Big Data. As a cornerstone of organizational culture, PbD is a concept that allows organizations of any size to embrace the privacy interests of the data they collect, store, and use at the forefront of their approach2.

AB  - With over 1.7 billion individuals engaged in social media, patients and consumers share more about their lives than ever before through wearable devices, smartphone applications, and social media outlets. This cornucopia of data offers significant opportunity for health researchers and clinicians to track and explore how digital presence contributes to patients' health outcomes and use of health care resources. While patients readily share their information with online communities, it is imperative that they maintain a sense of autonomy over who has access to such data. Recent data breaches of major insurance companies and retailers illustrate the challenges and vulnerabilities related to information safety and privacy. Many Web sites and mobile apps require users to agree to data policies, but how those data are mined, protected, used, and externally shared is frequently nontransparent, resulting in a climate of fear and distrust around all forums of digital information sharing. Although such skepticism is perhaps justified, it should not deter health researchers from attempting to collect and analyze these novel data for the purpose of designing unique health interventions. By clarifying intent around digital data acquisition, simplifying consent procedures, and affirming a commit ment to privacy, the authors contend that health researchers can partner with patients to transform the boundaries of scientific inquiry. © 2015 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - Computer and internet surveillance is widely used in organizations to monitor employees' activities on computers and the internet. Even though computer and internet surveillance helps to protect and secure property in an enterprise, employees are concerned that their privacy rights have been invaded under constant surveillance. Studies have been performed to investigate the effect of organizational settings, with different types of cultures having different effects on the implementation of surveillance practices and policies. In addition, employees' trust of surveillance systems and policies has been investigated. This study demonstrated that practicing computer and internet surveillance in different organizational cultures reveals different perceptions of information privacy and trust. This explains why the results of the practice of electronic surveillance vary depending on the type of enterprise. This study provides a better understanding of employees' perceptions of privacy and trust in practicing computer and internet surveillance. © 2016 CRL Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Potential benefits of using cloud computing services are remarkable. However, organizations still hesitate to use it because of the challenges of using such services, including service availability, data security and privacy, and system standard and data transferability. Additionally, organizational culture is recognized to have significant influence on organizations' adoption of cloud computing services. Recent studies of cloud computing services mainly focus on its economic benefits, technical application, and performance. Nevertheless, very few studies have investigated it from the perspective of organizational culture. Consequently, this research adopts the Information System Success model as a theoretical basis to develop a theoretical model for investigating the impact of organizational culture on organizations' intention of using cloud computing services. The research results are expected to shed lights on how the system quality, information quality, and service quality of cloud computing services may influence user satisfaction and intention to use such services in organizations, and how different types of organizational cultures may moderate the influence of system-related quality factors on users' intention to use cloud computing services.

AB  - This paper provides a literature review on security and privacy issues of big data. These issues are classified into three contexts; technological, organizational and environmental that is meant to facilitate future research. The main objectives of the review are to identify security and privacy issues of big data and to categorize the issues into a classification framework. The outcome of this review reveals that security and privacy issues of big data not only originate from technological deficiencies, but it may also be the outcome of organizational culture and environmental influences. At the end of review for each of the contexts, main issues were extracted and presented as potential factors that may affect organizational intention to adopt big data. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to identify organizations’ information security issues and to explore dynamic, organizational culture and contingency theories to develop an implementable framework for information security systems in human service organizations (HSOs) based soundly in theory and practice. Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes a critical review of global information security management issues for HSOs and relevant multi-disciplinary organizational theories to address them. Findings: Effective information security management can be particularly challenging to HSO because of their use of volunteer staff in a borderless electronic environment. Organizations’ lack of recognition of the need for staff awareness of information security threats and for training in secure work practices, particularly in terms of maintaining clients’ privacy and confidentiality, is a major issue. The dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation, organizational culture theory and contingency theory were identified as the most suitable theoretical perspectives to address this issue and underpin an effective information security management framework for HSOs. Research limitations/implications: The theory-based framework presented here has not been tested in practice. Such testing will be carried out in further research. Originality/value: Currently, there is no framework for information security systems in HSOs. The framework developed here provides a foundation on which HSO can build information security systems specific to their needs. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Privacy and security concerns are pervasive because of the ease of access to information. Recurrent negative cases in the popular press attest to the failure of current privacy regulations to keep consumer and protected health information sufficiently secure in today’s climate of increased IT use. One reason for such failure is that organizations violate these regulations for multiple reasons. To address this issue, we propose a theoretical model to explain the likelihood that organizations will select an externally governed privacy or security rule for violation in response to organizational strain or slack resources. Our proposed theoretical model, the selective organizational information privacy and security violations model (SOIPSVM), explains how organizational structures and processes, along with characteristics of regulatory rules, alter perceptions of risk when an organization’s performance does not match its aspiration levels and, thereby, affects the likelihood of rule violations. Importantly, we contextualize SOIPSVM to organizational privacy and security violations. SOIPSVM builds on and extends the selective organizational rule violations model (SORVM), which posits that organizational rule violations are selective. SOIPSVM provides at least four contributions to the privacy and security literature that can further guide empirical research and practice. First, SOIPSVM introduces the concept of selectivity in rule violations to privacy and security research. This concept can improve privacy and security research by showing that organizational violations of privacy and security rules are dynamic and selective yet influenced by external forces. Second, SOIPSVM extends the boundaries of SORVM, which is limited to explaining the behavior of organizations under strain, such as economic hardship. We contribute to the theory of selective deviance by proposing that selectivity extends to organizations with slack resources. Third, we address ideas of non-economic risk and strain in addition to economic risk and strain. Thus, SOIPSVM explains organizational rule-violating behavior as an attempt to protect core organizational values from external entities that pressure organizations to change their values to comply with rules. Fourth, we broaden the theoretical scope of two important constructs (namely, structural secrecy and procedural emphasis) to improve the model’s explanatory power. Fifth, we identify important elements of rule enforcement by drawing from the tenets of general deterrence theory. We also discuss how one can study constructs from general deterrence theory at the organizational level. To conclude, we offer recommendations for the structuring of organizations and external regulations to decrease organizational rule violations, which often lead to the abuse of consumer information. © 2016 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Introduction: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires that residency programs ensure resident competency in performing safe, effective handoffs. Understanding resident, attending, and nurse perceptions of the key elements of a safe and effective emergency department (ED) handoff is a crucial step to developing feasible, acceptable educational interventions to teach and assess this fundamental competency. The aim of our study was to identify the essential themes of ED-based handoffs and to explore the key cultural and interprofessional themes that may be barriers to developing and implementing successful ED-based educational handoff interventions. Methods: Using a grounded theory approach and constructivist/interpretivist research paradigm, we analyzed data from three primary and one confirmatory focus groups (FGs) at an urban, academic ED. FG protocols were developed using open-ended questions that sought to understand what participants felt were the crucial elements of ED handoffs. ED residents, attendings, a physician assistant, and nurses participated in the FGs. FGs were observed, hand-transcribed, audiorecorded and subsequently transcribed. We analyzed data using an iterative process of theme and subtheme identification. Saturation was reached during the third FG, and the fourth confirmatory group reinforced the identified themes. Two team members analyzed the transcripts separately and identified the same major themes. Results: ED providers identified that crucial elements of ED handoff include the following: 1) Culture (provider buy-in, openness to change, shared expectations of sign-out goals); 2) Time (brevity, interruptions, waiting); 3) Environment (physical location, ED factors); 4) Process (standardization, information order, tools). Conclusion: Key participants in the ED handoff process perceive that the crucial elements of intershift handoffs involve the themes of culture, time, environment, and process. Attention to these themes may improve the feasibility and acceptance of educational interventions that aim to teach and assess handoff competency. © 2015 by the article author(s).

AB  - Bring your own device or BYOD is one of the technological trends that give direct impact for organizations, because of technology information adaptation in organizations. BYOD referred to an environment in which employees use personal technology such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and even desktop PCs - to access corporate networks, applications, and data. Furthermore, basic motivation of this study is trying to answer whether implementing BYOD in organizations with respect to organizational culture and adaptation of cloud management control, may gives better result while implementing it without considering organizational culture and adaptation of cloud management control. In this study, the organizational culture will refer to OCAI organizational types and BYOD implementation will refer to BYOD privacy concerns indicators. This paper shall discuss the formulation and methodology to develop a proposed framework and the expected benefits while implementing BYOD by considering organizations culture. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A significant volume of security breaches occur as a result of the human aspects and it is consequently important for these to be given attention alongside technical aspects. Many breaches occur due to human error. Researchers have argued that security culture stimulates appropriate employees’ security behavior towards adherence and therefore developing a culture of security can contribute in minimizing or avoiding security breaches. Although, research on the concept of security culture has received little attention this paper aims to address the security culture concept, and it’s relation to the national culture. Specifically, it is largely hypothesized that cultivating security culture can have a positive effect on employees’ security compliance. The purpose of this paper is to identify variables that influence cultivating a security culture. In order to do so, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted. The outcome of the literature analysis has identified potential variables that influence security culture (e.g. top management support, information security behavior, and awareness), and the paper subsequently outlines a framework for modeling security culture that indicates the relationship between these variables. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - New technologies are promising us many upsides like enhanced health, convenience, productivity, safety, and more useful data, information and knowledge for people and organizations. The potential downsides are challenges to personal privacy, over-hyped expectations, increasing technological complexity that boggles us. Our point is this change requires scientific discussion from the point of management, leadership and organizations – that is, it is time to discuss the meaning of these challenges seriously also in terms of existing traditions of management science. This review type article discusses the nature and role of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and other key technological waves of ubiquitous revolution vis-á-vis the existing knowledge on management, organizations and knowledge management practices in organizations. Recent changes in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence and automation technology indicate that all kinds of intelligence and smartness are increasing and organizational cultures are going to change indicating fast changes in the field of modern management and management sciences. Organizational processes form the base for the knowledge-based decision-making. Developing and utilizing smart solutions – like the utilization of Big Data – emphasize the importance of open system thinking. Digitalized services can for instance create new interfaces between service providers and users. Service users create social value while they are participating in co-producing activities. Hence, the IoT and Big Data undoubtedly strengthen the role of participation in service production, service economy, innovativeness in-between organizations (as a joint processes) and leadership models incorporated in service-dominant –logic. Moreover, IoT, Big Data, and especially digitalization bring about the renaissance of knowledge in decision-making. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate privacy boundaries and explores employees' reactions in employee monitoring. Design/methodology/approach - The research used the metaphor of boundary turbulence in the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory to demonstrate the psychological effect on employees. The model comprised organizational culture, CPM, trust, and employee performance in employee monitoring to further investigated the influence exerted by organizational culture and how employees viewed their trust within the organization when implementing employee monitoring. Variables were measured empirically by administrating questionnaires to full-time employees in organizations that currently practice employee monitoring. Findings - The findings showed that a control-oriented organizational culture raised communication privacy turbulence in CPM. The communication privacy turbulence in CPM mostly had negative effects on trust in employee monitoring policy, but not on trust in employee monitoring members. Both trust in employee monitoring policy and trust in employee monitoring members had positive effects on employee commitment and compliance to employee monitoring. Research limitations/implications - This research applied the CPM theory in workplace privacy to explore the relationship between employees' privacy and trust. The results provide insights of why employees feel psychological resistance when they are forced to accept the practice of employee monitoring. In addition, this study explored the relationship between CPM and trust, and offer support and verification to prior studies. Practical implications - For practitioners, the findings help organizations to improve the performance of their employees and to design a more effective environment for employee monitoring. Originality/value - A research model was proposed to study the impacts of CPM on employee monitoring, after a broad survey on related researches. The validated model and its corresponding study results can be referenced by organization managers and decision makers to make favorable tactics for achieving their goals of implementing employee monitoring. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: HIV-related stigma and discrimination and disrespect and abuse during childbirth are barriers to use of essential maternal and HIV health services. Greater understanding of the relationship between HIV status and disrespect and abuse during childbirth is required to design interventions to promote women's rights and to increase uptake of and retention in health services; however, few comparative studies of women living with HIV (WLWH) and HIV-negative women exist.
Methods: Mixed methods included interviews with postpartum women (n = 2000), direct observation during childbirth (n = 208), structured questionnaires (n = 50), and in-depth interviews (n = 18) with health care providers. Bivariate and multivariate regressions analyzed associations between HIV status and disrespect and abuse, whereas questionnaires and in-depth interviews provided insight into how provider attitudes and workplace culture influence practice.
Results: Of the WLWH and HIV-negative women, 12.2% and 15.0% reported experiencing disrespect and abuse during childbirth (P = 0.37), respectively. In adjusted analyses, no significant differences between WLWH and HIV-negative women's experiences of different types of disrespect and abuse were identified, with the exception of WLWH having greater odds of reporting non-consented care (P = 0.03). None of the WLWH reported violations of HIV confidentiality or attributed disrespect and abuse to their HIV status. Provider interviews indicated that training and supervision focused on prevention of vertical HIV transmission had contributed to changing the institutional culture and reducing HIV-related violations.
Conclusions: In general, WLWH were not more likely to report disrespect and abuse during childbirth than HIV-negative women. However, the high overall prevalence of disrespect and abuse measured indicates a serious problem. Similar institutional priority as has been given to training and supervision to reduce HIV-related discrimination during childbirth should be focused on ensuring respectful maternity care for all women.

AB  - To promote accountability, productivity, and shared learning, many organizations create open work environments and gather reams of data on how individuals spend their time. A few years ago, HBS professor Ethan Bernstein set out to find empirical evidence that such approaches improve organizational performance. What he discovered is that this kind of transparency often has an unintended consequence: It can leave employees feeling vulnerable and exposed. When that happens, they conceal any conduct that deviates from the norm so that they won't have to explain it. Unrehearsed, experimental behaviors sometimes stop altogether. But Bernstein also discovered organizations that had established zones of privacy within open environments by setting four types of boundaries: around teams, between feedback and evaluation, between decision rights and improvement rights, and around periods of experimentation. Moreover, across several studies, the companies that had done all this were the ones that consistently got the most creative, efficient, and thoughtful work from their employees. Bernstein's conclusion? By balancing transparency and privacy, organizations can capture the benefits of both, and encourage just the right amount of "positive deviance" needed to increase innovation and productivity.

AB  - The open office is the dominant form of workspace design for good reason: It fosters collaboration, promotes learning, and nurtures strong culture. But what most companies fail to realize is that collaboration has a natural rhythm that requires both interaction and private contemplation. Companies have been trying for decades to find the balance between public and private workspace that best supports collaboration. In 1980 52% of U.S. employees lacked workspaces where they could concentrate without distraction. In response, high-walled cubicles took over the corporate landscape. By the late 1990s, the tide had turned, and only 23% of employees wanted more privacy, and 50% wanted more access to other people. Ever since, firms have been beefing up spaces that support collaboration and shrinking areas for individual work. But the pendulum seems to have swung too far: Once again, people feel a pressing need for privacy, not only to do heads-down work but to cope with the intensity of work today. To address these needs, according to the authors, we have to rethink our assumptions about privacy. Traditionally defined in physical terms, privacy is now about the individual's ability to control information and stimulation. In this article, the authors examine workspace design through the new lens of privacy and offer insights on how to foster teamwork and solitude.

AB  - An increasing number of information security breaches in organisations presents a potentially serious threat to the privacy and confidentiality of personal and commercially sensitive data. Recent research shows that human beings are the weakest link in the security chain and the root cause of a great portion of security breaches. In the late 1990’s, a new phenomenon called “information security culture” has emerged as a measure to promote security-cautious behaviour of employees in organisational settings. The concept of information security culture is relatively new and research on the subject is still evolving. This research-in-progress paper contributes to our understanding of this very important topic by offering a conceptualisation of information security culture. Additionally, this study indentifies factors that instigate adverse employee behaviour in organisations. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.

AB  - Digitized and born digital images are being created and disseminated at an ever-increasing rate as the by-products of business activities and the residue of organizational culture. In the past decade, the popularity of digitization as an archival activity aimed at preserving vulnerable archival materials and providing increased access to archival collections has presented archivists with a number of challenges including: platform interoperability, access controls, scalable infrastructure and privacy and rights management. The Cloud presents a range of solutions to the problems posed by managing large data sets such as digital image collections; however, at this early stage the benefits and risks associated with cloud-based services are still being identified. This paper will discuss the current state of digital imaging and highlight key issues in the creation and use, management, and preservation of digital images as trustworthy records in the context of an evolving online environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB  - Purpose Research on employers' experiences with return to work (RTW) of employees with breast cancer is lacking. Employers seem to be the key people to create good working conditions. Our aim is to explore how Belgian employers experience their role and responsibility in RTW of employees with breast cancer. Methods Using a qualitative design (Grounded Theory) 17 employers from the public (7), private (5) and non-profit (5) sector, directly involved in the RTW process, were interviewed. The analysis was based on the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL) with constant data comparison and interactive team dialogue as important guiding characteristics. Results RTW of employees with breast cancer is experienced by employers as an intangible process that is difficult to manage. This was expressed in (1) concern, referring to the employer's personal and emotional involvement, (2) uncertainty about the course of illness and the guidance needed by the employee and (3) specific dilemmas in the RTW process (when does one infringe on employee privacy; employee vs. organization interest; employers' personal vs. professional role). The degree to which this was experienced related to variety in organizational, employer, and employee factors. Conclusions The findings of this study confirm the importance of the employer's involvement in RTW of employees with breast cancer and contribute to a better understanding of its complexity. The employers did their best to grasp the intangibility of the RTW process. Further research is needed to refine these findings and to discover the specific needs of employers regarding supporting RTW of breast cancer patients. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Over the past three decades, two separate federal regulatory structures have emerged, each seeking to assure separate aspects of the integrity and ethics of research conducted using federal funding. One set of regulations is described in the Public Health Service Policies on Research Misconduct and relates to research misconduct, defined as consisting of fabrication of data or results, falsification of data and results, or plagiarism, in accordance with the federal-wide definition adopted by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The second set of regulations, set forth in the Department of Health and Human Services regulations on the protection of human subjects (known as the "Common Rule"), prescribes a set of ethical and procedural protections for research involving human subjects. These two sets of research regulations are distinguished from each other by having different foci of enforcement, priorities of protection, oversight officials, oversight procedures, seizure of evidence, standards of proof, expectations of privacy, and appeal procedures for researchers who are subject to adverse findings and penalties. These differences are significant and fundamental. They complicate the process of compliance for institutions and researchers, who are expected to adhere to both sets of standards for the same federally funded research activities in research with human subjects. Compliance is especially complicated when suspected violations of both sets of standards must be investigated and resolved concurrently. This document represents an effort to provide institutions and individuals with practical suggestions as they try to comply with both sets of regulations. © 2014 The Hastings Center.

AB  - Norms and values are part of the organizational culture. While the values support the agent's autonomy by representing its character and helping to make decisions and execute actions, the norms are used by the system to cope with the autonomy of the agents by regulating their behavior and the execution of actions. One of the main challenges faced by agents at runtime is the conflicts that may arise between the systems norms and their values. The goals of this paper are to point out the conflict cases between norms and values and to propose an algorithm to help the agent to identify those conflict cases. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the information culture of a medium-sized municipality in Belgium. Public information/records is/are one of the most important instruments of citizens' control of public authorities. The principle of Public Access gives citizens a right to access public records, while the Privacy Act protects the integrity of the citizens. Municipalities are institutions that intensely interact with the citizens. Therefore, the way they handle the information that is generated during this interaction is of crucial importance to the efficient service delivery, safeguarding the rights of the citizens that they serve and for sustaining the open governance structure that promotes the principles of accountability and transparency. Design/methodology/approach: The author employed a case study approach in order to establish the attitudes and norms the organizational employees had towards the management of information/records. She also applied the information culture assessment framework developed by Oliver during the design of the research questions. Findings: Information culture affects the way public information/records are managed. Though investments are being made in information systems to facilitate the capture and management of information/records, the people issues are equally as crucial. E-Government development will require an information culture that promotes effective creation, use and management of information, if its goal of efficient and transparent public administrations is to be achieved. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in the application of the information culture assessment framework that was developed by Oliver. The framework facilitates the formulation of questions using its three layers to tease out the information required by a researcher in an attempt to draw conclusions regarding the attitudes, norms and the value the interviewees attach to information/records. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Concept mapping (Trochim, ) was used to visually articulate the full range of organizing outcomes from a grassroots community organization (GCO) in a western United States city. Outcomes belong to five general categories: (a) victories, (b) personal development, (c) public leadership skills, (d) organizational relationships with power people, and (e) building an organizational culture of civic engagement. Results from the concept map have been triangulated with other GCO data sources to determine whether the concept map presents a credible representation of the range of outcomes which can be expected from community organizing. Advantages of concept mapping as a method for community-based research are discussed. Names of places and organizations have been changed to protect the privacy of participants. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose To explore medical and non-medical practitioners' views of the impact of ehealth on shared care. Method A systematic review was conducted using a meta-narrative approach with publication search dates limited from 1 January 2005 to 28 February 2011 and English language only. Search results from the databases (ASLIB, EBSCO Host, Cochrane Library, Informa Healthcare, PsycNet, Sciverse Scopus, Zetoc) were independently reviewed and data extracted by two of the authors. The review included peer reviewed papers about medical and non-medical practitioners who provide ehealth supported shared care. Articles which focused solely on searching the internet or exchange of emails were excluded. Results Screening reduced the initial 327 papers identified to 12 which included three reviews, four qualitative, two mixed methods and three quantitative studies. Included studies collected data using combinations of questionnaires, case study, group/individual interviews, observation and extraction of data from records. Data were analysed using thematic, interpretive, analytic induction/ constant comparative and statistical analysis methods. Practice settings were primary care, secondary care or both. The focus was on electronic records (7), telemedicine (2) or general ehealth implementation (3) predominantly from the perspective of doctors, nurses, IT developers, policy makers and managers plus one hospital pharmacist. The studies showed acceptance of ehealth technologies to support increasing levels of shared care but with cost effectiveness, level of resourcing and training questioned by respondents. Emerging themes across all study types were organisational, social and technical: resource and time implications, culture of the workplace and change management requirements; impact on patient consultation, extra workload, need for training suited to varying levels of IT literacy, usability, patient privacy and the practitioner's role; systems incompatibility, technological inadequacies, need for shared definition and terminology. Conclusions Findings indicate acceptance of ehealth to support shared care but question anticipated efficiencies. Organisational, social and technical issues identified were similar to non-healthcare IT implementations and adoption of innovation theory. Evidence of medical and non-medical practitioners' views of the impact of ehealth on shared care remains limited with further areas for pharmacy ehealth research identified.

AB  - Speaking of the public response to the deaths of children at the Bristol Royal Infirmary before 2001, the BMJ commented that the NHS would be 'all changed, changed utterly'. Today, two inquiries into the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust suggest nothing changed at all. Many patients died as a result of their care and the stories of indifference and neglect there are harrowing. Yet Bristol and Mid Staffordshire are not isolated reports. In 2011, the Health Services Ombudsman reported on the care of elderly and frail patients in the NHS and found a failure to recognise their humanity and individuality and to respond to them with sensitivity, compassion and professionalism. Likewise, the Care Quality Commission and Healthcare Commission received complaints from patients and relatives about the quality of nursing care. These included patients not being fed, patients left in soiled bedding, poor hygiene practices, and general disregard for privacy and dignity. Why is there such tolerance of poor clinical standards? We need a better understanding of the circumstances that can lead to these outcomes and how best to respond to them. We discuss the findings of these and other reports and consider whether attention should be devoted to managing individual behaviour, or focus on the systemic influences which predispose hospital staff to behave in this way. Lastly, we consider whether we should look further afield to cognitive psychology to better understand how clinicians and managers make decisions?

AB  - The use of Web 2.0 social media such as Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and virtual worlds is rapidly increasing and transformational modes of communication are emerging (Greenhow, Robelia & Hughes, 2009; Godwin, 2008; O'Reilly, 2005). Public and private sector organizations are faced with the challenges of adapting their communication practices to the rapidly changing demands of the social media environment that present risks to both information security and privacy, changes to long-established policies and organizational culture, and the rewards of deeper involvement and collaboration with users. As social media transforms communication within all organizations, its potential to transform learning is also becoming apparent. This chapter promotes a better understanding of the effects social media has on learning and the importance to learners and the learning process, with special emphasis on its effect when combining face-to-face and distance learning. The subtopic for this chapter, HCI for the Web 2.0 environment seen through a corporate training lens, is emphasized with education and training examples from corporate, K-12, university and government sectors. © 2013 by IGI Global.

AB  - Purpose Work disability research has found co-worker support to be a significant but under-recognised aspect of work reintegration (WR) processes. Although co-workers work alongside returning workers, their practical contribution to WR success or failure is often invisible to others. This study aimed to gain further insight into the role and contribution of co-workers in WR interventions. Method An exploratory qualitative pilot study was conducted in Toronto, Canada in 2011. Three focus groups were conducted with 13 co-workers, recruited for their direct experience of 'working alongside' a returning worker. An iterative data gathering and analysis process occurred. Themes were generated from categories in open-ended interview questions and new issues arising from the data. Findings The findings detail co-workers' practical experiences of WR processes and their reflections on social and work conditions that impacted their participation. Co-workers' capacity to support returning workers was related to the quality of the WR arrangements, the relationship with the returning worker, work culture, and the duration of the required support. Workplace privacy and confidentiality requirements were identified as a key challenge for co-worker participation. The effects on co-workers of WR processes ranged from the opportunity to learn new skills to disillusionment and withdrawal from the workplace. In worst case scenarios, 'ripple effects' including emotional distress, physical injury and termination of co-workers' employment had occurred. Conclusion Co-workers are not a neutral party in WR procedures. Formalizing the co-worker role to include communication, consideration and recognition might improve co-workers' WR experiences. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Child welfare workers speak of the satisfaction of knowing they have made a critical difference in children's lives; at the same time, there is also the difficulty of dealing with the stressful aspects of working in this field. Some level of stress is inherent in child welfare work, and this affects both individuals and organizations. Exposure to details of the suffering of maltreated children is a job requirement for child welfare workers as they carefully investigate maltreatment allegations and interact with people who often do not want to see them and who may threaten them or try to hurt them. In addition to their day-to-day responsibilities, child welfare workers may also have to face the news of a child's injury or death that they could not prevent. The combination of all of these factors can certainly be extremely taxing, and severely stressful events can result in negative effects on functioning in child welfare workers, such as traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. Child welfare organizations can suffer from traumatic stress in ways that are analogous to the suffering of individuals. Organizations face the stress of using increasingly scarce resources in trying to meet great need. Severe budget cuts and the assignment of additional tasks without receiving additional funds only add to the stress inherent in child welfare work for an already overburdened workforce. In addition, environmental stressors are added to the mix for both individuals and organizations, such as lack of understanding of the work of child welfare by the general public. Child welfare workers are required to protect child and family privacy, so the many successful cases in this field rarely come to public attention in the way that cases involving disastrous outcomes often do. Child welfare administrators are prohibited from speaking about specific cases, such as the death of a child, and can only respond in very general terms. Child welfare workers thus have little voice in addressing public perceptions and cannot explain or defend the decisions they must make. Workers may have pre-existing risk factors and face the likelihood of both primary and secondary exposure to traumatic stressors in the course of their everyday work. Any resulting traumatic stress is likely to involve significant suffering and potentially affect work quality and staff turnover. Approaches to the problem may occur at the client level, the worker level, and the organizational level. Since the problem affects an entire organizational system and all its members, organizational- level approaches, while time consuming and initially costly, may be the most promising in providing relief from suffering, and may be more cost effective in the long run. Significant research evidence exists concerning the risks for and potential impact of worker traumatic stress and materials providing approaches are becoming increasingly available. Evidence of effectiveness of these approaches is beginning to emerge and will hopefully continue to grow, showing the way forward in dealing with one of the major concerns in the field of child welfare. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - In today's academic library reality, space is a valuable commodity. Space utilization will change with the trends and demands of higher education. When a library changes the use of space in just one area, it will affect the entire environment and all the employees who work there. If change is unilaterally imposed on library staff, the overall organizational culture can shift to one of distrust, frustration, and anger towards library administration. This shift in organizational culture could eventually lead to organizational failure. By using established frameworks for office space design, library administration can mitigate the chances of organizational failure while still meeting employees' needs for privacy, personal work processes, and teamwork. This chapter discusses the characteristics of openness, density, architectural accessibility, darkness, and social space in office design and provides a planning checklist to aid the redesign process. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - We've all experienced gossiping, missed deadlines, someone taking credit for another's work, and little white lies. These and other breaches of trust are commonplace. However, they do more damage in the medical practice than many practice managers realize. This article argues that medical practice employees need to trust their managers, patients, doctors, one another, and even the security of their jobs so they are able to focus on their daily tasks and perform well. It defines trust as both a logical and emotional act and describes common breaches of workplace trust. It defines three characteristics of high-trust organizations and illustrates through examples how practice managers can demonstrate their trustworthiness through their actions, not only through their words. This article also offers seven steps for rebuilding trust that has been breached. It offers readers two instruments: a survey tool practice managers can use to assess the trust in their practices and a self-quiz practice managers can take to assess their own trustworthiness. Finally, this article offers research about the impact of trust on the bottom line and 10 truths about trust that medical practice managers can share with their employees.

AB  - This paper describes an exploratory study on school-level e-safety policy development. The research was based on the participatory design-based methodology, involving various stakeholders in a school-level policy development exercise. Our aim was to find out whether the schools with open and participatory culture would choose more flexible, emancipatory and participatory approach to e-safety policy development, while schools with rationalmanagerial organizational culture tend to rely on prescriptive approaches and technology-driven solutions in their e-safety policies. Regarding future research, we plan to continue the work to construct a new design and development platform to be used in a more flexible and bottom-up manner instead of strict prescriptive rule sets provided on the national level. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - The paper presents organisational semiotics (OS) as an approach for identifying organisational readiness factors for internal use of social media within information intensive organisations (IIO). The paper examines OS methods, such as organisational morphology, containment analysis and collateral analysis to reveal factors of readiness within an organisation. These models also help to identify the essential patterns of activities needed for social media use within an organisation, which can provide a basis for future analysis. The findings confirmed many of the factors, previously identified in literature, while also revealing new factors using OS methods. The factors for organisational readiness for internal use of social media include resources, organisational climate, processes, motivational readiness, benefit and organisational control factors. Organisational control factors revealed are security/privacy, policies, communication procedures, accountability and fallback. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper discusses the results of research into user satisfaction in three healthcare facilities at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. The analysis is based on the concepts of user satisfaction and responsiveness. Perceptions and opinions of outpatients from Instituto de Pesquisa Evandro Chagas, Instituto Fernandes Figueira and Centro de Saúde Escola Germano Sinval Faria were investigated. Intention samples were drawn for each institution and a total of 1.339 valid questionnaires were obtained. The study found that patients are satisfied with healthcare at Fiocruz, especially with health professionals. Nevertheless, restroom hygiene and privacy during consultations were less well evaluated. The improvement of these aspects depends not only on financial and technological investments but on changes in organizational culture. The first part of the paper discusses the literature on user satisfaction and responsiveness, with the definition of the categories that guided the study. The methodology is then presented as well as the four health services dimensions assessed - dignity, agility, facilities and communication - and the results are analyzed.

AB  - Background: Further insight is needed to better understand how beliefs impact on contemporary Australian Emergency Department (ED) triage nursing practice. Specifically, how do cultural notions drive beliefs that give shape to nursing practice? Methods: Ethnography was the methodological framework used to explore triage practice. A purposeful sample of 10 Triage Nurses across four EDs was selected. Two hundred hours of nonparticipant observation were collected. Results: Beliefs were identified that gave meaning to triage nursing behaviour and action. Belief 1: Respecting space and privacy; Belief 2: Taking control and responsibility; Belief 3: Patients should not arrive with expectations; Belief 4: Do not ask for a bed; Belief 5: Expect a level playing field; Belief 6: No benefit from having a referral letter; Belief 7: Do not waste time. When a belief was engaged Triage Nurses implemented a range of practices, which were culturally oriented and at times at odds with patient expectations and care. Conclusion: The ethnographic study made visible an ED culture of timeliness, appropriateness and efficiency which perpetuated beliefs that framed notions of service worthiness and appropriateness. Making explicit beliefs can assist clinicians to be more considered, sensitive and culturally competent to meet the growing demand for emergency care. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dignity is a human right and a base for human health. This right must be observed in work environments as a moral obligation. This qualitative study aimed to understand nurses' experiences of violation of their dignity at work and to explore its dimensions. The participants were 15 nurses working in two hospitals in Tehran. The data were collected through 26 unstructured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. The dimensions of violation were 'irreverence', including experiences of abuse and violence, humiliation, and being ignored; 'coercion and violation of autonomy', consisting of the control of relationships, lack of privacy, rigidness, and imposition; 'ignoring professional and scientific ability', indicating impossibilities in applying nurses' knowledge; and 'denying the value of nurse/care', being the theme that verified the dominance of treatment/cure and lack of recognition of care value. Health systems should take the promotion of the nurses' dignity into account through providing a dignified work environment. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - The authors propose that the characteristics of personal (individual) compassion may be extrapolated to the concept of corporate (organizational) compassion. Modern health care facilities attract staff members who are able to exercise varying degrees of compassion in their busy daily routines. However, little discussion has taken place on how health care organizations might best harness and integrate aspects of individual compassion to create an organization with compassion as a core value. We define three characteristics of a "compassionate hospital" as 1) the presence of a healing environment, 2) a sense of connection among people, and 3) a sense of purpose and identity. We suggest how a "top down" focus on compassion as a core value by clinical leaders could maximize the compassion of health care workers, and reduce the suffering expressed and/or experienced by health care workers and patients in today's health care facilities. The compassionate hospital concept is intended to act as a proposition for health policy researchers and decision-makers in health care so as to reduce the suffering of sick patients, and to restore a sense of well-being, meaning, and purpose among health care workers. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The proliferation of information in modern society, as enabled by technologies such as portable personal devices, social media, and "cloud"-based services, presents a potentially serious threat to individual privacy and the security of corporate data. Despite various technology tools designed to protect organisations' vital information assets, security breaches within organisations continue to occur. In the 1990s, researchers realised that technical tools alone cannot solve the problem of IS security incidents and they began to focus their attention on socio-organisational aspects. A "human factor" problem has been recognised as the root cause of many security breaches. According to recent research, information security culture needs to be created in organisations in order to promote security-cautious behaviour of employees to avoid such incidents. The concept of information security culture is relatively new and research on this topic is underdeveloped. We submit that there is a need for research that explores the principal factors that impact upon the fostering of information security culture within organisations and how these factors change within different cultural contexts.

AB  - Implementing organization-wide ICT infrastructures is a challenging endeavor, even more so when the technology in question is both a network technology and raises privacy concerns among employees. This teaching case introduces students to the German insurance provider FINTOP in the final stages of planning its organization-wide roll-out of the Real Time Communication and Collaboration (RTC) technology IBM Lotus Sametime. FINTOP's IT management is faced with the challenge of how to design the roll-out process in the face of a strong management vision, various stakeholder concerns and a culture of employee participation in decision making. The case is targeted at postgraduate or advanced undergraduate Information Systems students. Its aim is to provide instructors with a multi-faceted case that exposes students to the political nature of IT decision making, as well as the particular nature and characteristics of communication infrastructures. As network technologies, such infrastructures are quite different from more traditional enterprise systems due to their openness to accommodate a wide range of use cases. At the same time communication infrastructures, such as instant messaging and social media are making strong inroads into organizations currently.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone technology has demonstrated the potential to improve health service delivery, but there is little guidance to inform decisions about acquiring and implementing mHealth technology at scale in health systems. Using the case of community-based health services (CBS) in South Africa, we apply a framework to appraise the opportunities and challenges to effective implementation of mHealth at scale in health systems. Methods. A qualitative study reviewed the benefits and challenges of mHealth in community-based services in South Africa, through a combination of key informant interviews, site visits to local projects and document reviews. Using a framework adapted from three approaches to reviewing sustainable information and communication technology (ICT), the lessons from local experience and elsewhere formed the basis of a wider consideration of scale up challenges in South Africa. Results: Four key system dimensions were identified and assessed: government stewardship and the organisational, technological and financial systems. In South Africa, the opportunities for successful implementation of mHealth include the high prevalence of mobile phones, a supportive policy environment for eHealth, successful use of mHealth for CBS in a number of projects and a well-developed ICT industry. However there are weaknesses in other key health systems areas such as organisational culture and capacity for using health information for management, and the poor availability and use of ICT in primary health care. The technological challenges include the complexity of ensuring interoperability and integration of information systems and securing privacy of information. Finally, there are the challenges of sustainable financing required for large scale use of mobile phone technology in resource limited settings. Conclusion: Against a background of a health system with a weak ICT environment and limited implementation capacity, it remains uncertain that the potential benefits of mHealth for CBS would be retained with immediate large-scale implementation. Applying a health systems framework facilitated a systematic appraisal of potential challenges to scaling up mHealth for CBS in South Africa and may be useful for policy and practice decision-making in other low- and middle-income settings. © 2012 Leon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Leadership behaviours of executives in healthcare are considered to be of prime importance (Burke, 2006), with strategy, structure and process being key elements of team and organisational effectiveness (Yammarino et al, 2008). This research identified that executives were clear on what type of leadership behaviour is expected of them; seeing themselves as transformational, setting clear goals and expecting the best from their teams. They also identified elements of autocratic and transactional leadership were required frequently in the achievement of targets. There was acute recognition of the tensions between quality and safety and the target-driven approach required by commissioners and the current financial climate. External drivers for quality and safety included losing foundation trust status and the resultant financial penalties. It was acknowledged the commissioners have huge power and influence over the direction of where the organisation concentrates effort to influence policy which could also provide tension with the quality and safety strategy. Finance and 'doing more for less' are constant themes, with competition to keep quality and safety on the agenda. Quality and safety has a reputation for being problematic, many executives believed changing the organisational culture requires evaluation. © Copyright T & Cs Privacy.

AB  - Interprofessional practice implies that health professionals are able to contribute patient care in a collaborative environment. In this paper, it is argued that in a hospital the nurses' station is a form of symbolic power. The term could be reframed as a "health team hub," which fosters a place for communication and interprofessional working. Studies have found that design of the Nurses' Station can impact on the walking distance of hospital staff, privacy for patients and staff, jeopardize patient confidentiality and access to resources. However, no studies have explored the implications of nurses' station design on interprofessional practice. A multi-site collective case study of three rural hospitals in South Australia explored the collaborative working culture of each hospital. Of the cultural concepts being studied, the physical design of nurses' stations and the general physical environment were found to have a major influence on an effective collaborative practice. Communication barriers were related to poor design, lack of space, frequent interruptions and a lack of privacy; the name "nurses' station" denotes the space as the primary domain of nurses rather than a workspace for the healthcare team. Immersive work spaces could encourage all members of the healthcare team to communicate more readily with one another to promote interprofessional collaboration. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - How does a modern woman react to being defined by the role of wife? In our study, the authors examined the experiences, benefits, and challenges encountered by wives of college and university presidents. In a relationship where the husband has a prestigious and well-defined role, the female partner may still be expected to play a traditional role on a regular basis, bringing both benefits and challenges. Through focus groups, interviews, and a survey, women shared their experiences. Cluster analytic techniques identified six groups of women that were involved in, adjusted to, or conflicted by serving in the presidential spouse role. The authors employ the voices of the women themselves to illuminate their experiences, satisfactions, challenges, and frustrations. Wives indicated that they had to deal with loss of privacy, conflicted personal relationships, and increased ambiguity about their own identity. Interestingly, wives did not allow these challenges to undermine their marriage; instead, for those who had difficulty meeting these demands, the loss was to their own sense of self-worth. The results suggest that the role of presidential wife should be examined through the intersectional lens of gender and class. This intersection can be seen to shape the expectations of the wife herself, as well as the demands made by her spouse and others in her community. Her previous experiences, education, and career preparation provide insights into how she approaches the public role. Recognizing and giving voice to the complex sociocultural issues involved may help wives thrive in their roles as a college or university president's wife.

AB  - Effective management of modern public health emergencies requires the coordinated efforts of multiple agencies representing various disciplines. Organizational culture differences between public health (PH) and emergency management (EM) entities may hinder inter-agency collaboration. We examine how PH and EM differ in their approach to PH law and how such differences affect their collaboration towards PH preparedness. MethodsWe conducted 144 semi-structured interviews with local and state PH and EM officials between April 2008 and November 2009. Thematic qualitative analysis in ATLAS.ti was used to extract characteristics of each agency's approach to PH legal preparedness. ResultsTwo conflicting approaches to the law emerge. The PH approach is characterized by perceived uncertainty regarding legal authority over preparedness planning tasks; expectation for guidance on interpretation of existing laws; and concern about individual and organizational liability. The EM approach reveals perception of broad legal authority; flexible interpretation of existing laws; and ethical concerns over infringement of individual freedoms and privacy. ConclusionsDistinct interpretations of preparedness law impede effective collaboration for PH preparedness. Clarification of legal authority mandates, designation within laws of scope of preparedness activities and guidance on interpretation of current federal and state laws are needed. © The Author 2010, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

AB  - Purpose: Nurses heavily influence patient care quality and safety. This paper aims to examine socioeconomic and organizational/system factors affecting patient safety and quality perceptions. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was constructed to gather demographic, managerial support, information technology implementation and integration information. Data were collected from nurses in five Riyadh hospitals, Saudi Arabia. Registered nurses working in hospital departments participated in the survey. A total of 566 completed questionnaires were returned. Subsequent data were analyzed through binary logistic regression. Findings: Factors that improve patient safety and the likelihood that nurses use their own facility include: fewer visible errors; ability to communicate suggestions; information technology support and training; and a confidential error reporting system. Research limitations/implications: The survey was a cross-sectional study. Consequently, it is difficult to establish causation. Furthermore, nursing in these hospitals is dominated by foreign nationals. Also, as with all surveys, this research may be subject to response bias. Although the questionnaire was randomly distributed, there were no mechanisms to assure privacy and minimize peer influence. The high positive patient safety perceptions may be influenced by either individual or peer biases. Practical implications: Nurses are important communicators; especially about hospital safety and quality. The research informs leaders about areas that need considering and improving. Findings indicate that system factors, including functional feedback, suggestions, and error reporting significantly affect patient safety improvements. Likewise, nurse education to operate their information systems has positive effects. Healthcare leaders need to understand factors that affect patient safety perceptions when creating a patient safety culture. Originality/value: Few international articles examine the factors that influence nurses' patient safety perceptions or examine those factors that affect these perceptions. This paper adds value by researching what influences patient safety perceptions among Riyadh nurses. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper aims to understand how the interaction between knowledge management, organizational culture and ethics occur, focusing on the potential tensions between personal and collective knowledge in learning organizations. These tensions are reflected upon ethical and social dilemmas which are often neglected by managers and produce unexpected impactsinto the organizational strategy. Therefore, this contribution is divided into two main sections: knowledge management (levels, dimensions, and ethical issues/social dilemmas); empirical procedures (methodological design, data collection methods, and empirical outcomes). However, in order to promote a reliable argument, this manuscript will shed some light about the underlying topics. Knowledge management (KM) can be characterized as the acquisition and utilization of resources to generate a milieu in which information is available to all, allowing individuals to obtain, share and employ that information to increase their own knowledge and apply their knowledge for organizational benefit. Despite this consideration, KM as a strategy encompasses two antagonistic levels of analysis: personal knowledge management (PKM) and organizational knowledge management (OKM), leading to potential tensions. Moreover, the "knowledge continuum process" is synchronized throughout organizational culture, technology, and ethics. As a result, it is fundamental to approach the ethical issues (free access to organizational knowledge, autonomy, dignity, privacy, intellectual property, fair compensation), and social dilemmas (organizational trust) that literature claims. Moving forward, this research project unites descriptive and explanatory assumptions through an interpretative and critical epistemological study. Additionally, an embedded multiple-case study with grounded theory (multimethod) will be under scrutiny. Nevertheless, the complex and sensitive nature of the research imposes challenges regarding data collection methods (interviews and questionnaires), leading to protocol fine-tune in order to improve the level of confidence. In spite of these constraints, the empirical outcomes clearly demonstrate that a wide range of ethical issues and social dilemmas occur within organizational contexts, which managers do not recognize or neglect.

AB  - Implementing health information technology (IT) is a major strategic objective for providers. To pinpoint considerations that tie to success, the Premier health care alliance surveyed hospitals to develop an electronic health record best-practices library. Compiled from diverse health care organizations, the library outlines considerations to support "meaningful use" in the areas of computerized physician order entry, medication management, clinical documentation, reporting of measures, privacy, information exchange, management of populations' health, and personal health records. Best practices also uncovered strategies for securing executive leadership, culture change, communication, and support for clinicians. This paper summarizes lessons from the library, providing recommendations to speed up health IT implementation. ©2010 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.

AB  - The VA Cardiovascular Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking (CART) system is a customized electronic medical record system which provides standardized report generation for cardiac catheterization procedures, serves as a national data repository, and is the centerpiece of a national quality improvement program. Like many health information technology projects, CART implementation did not proceed without some barriers and resistance. We describe the nationwide implementation of CART at the 77 VA hospitals which perform cardiac catheterizations in three phases: (1) strategic collaborations; (2) installation; and (3) adoption. Throughout implementation, success required a careful balance of technical, clinical, and organizational factors. We offer strategies developed through CART implementation which are broadly applicable to technology projects aimed at improving the quality, reliability, and efficiency of health care. © 2009 Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - Background: The big challenge in social and health care is to integrate social and health care services, to develop patient empowering care models and to develop integrated electronic health records. Object: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation and first trial of the Regional Information System as experienced by professionals. Methods: The data was collected with a questionnaire and a log file of client-related events. The SPSS for Windows 14.0 statistical program was used in the analysis. Results were reported as direct distributions, percentages and averages. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate reliability. Statistical significance was tested with the chi-squared or Fisher Exact test. Results: Somatic nursing record data and laboratory results were viewed the most out of the links. Users were satisfied with the content of the data they received and its accuracy. Client privacy was safeguarded and patient data remained confidential. Those who have used the Regional Information System longer felt that information was retrieved and flowed more quickly - in particular, key information regarding the continuity and coordination of patient care such as basic patient data, laboratory data, medication data, appointments, future treatment data, case summaries and doctor's statements. Cooperation between different professional groups and organizations was felt to have improved. Recording of patient data and working practices were not considered to have improved. Conclusions: The integration and retrieval of data are not enough to ensure efficient and effective overall patient care. It is a real challenge to integrate care in a client-oriented way and to redistribute responsibility in the patient care process. It also requires the mixing of professional and organizational cultures.

AB  - Psychologists frequently collaborate in the care of patients managed in primary care. Communication with a patient's primary care team is important to ensure coordination and continuity of care. The communication is far from seamless. Although The Health Information Privacy and Portability Act (HIPPA) is designed to promote sharing of clinical information while protecting patient confidentiality, unique problems arise when mental health records are included. Mental health records are subject to different regulations to protect the patient's confidentiality. Thus, what is communicated and how it will be accomplished are challenges. Further, psychologists and primary care providers often view documentation differently, resulting in different styles of documenting that may also impede coordinated care. Increasingly, health care systems are moving toward electronic medical records, creating greater opportunities for an integrated record. Improved communication through the record can keep other providers abreast of the mental health care being provided as well as suggestions they can use to reinforce the mental health care treatment plan. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - AIM: To explore the perspectives of nurses working with children and young people on dignified care and the challenges of providing such care. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed including fixed response and free text questions. A survey link was emailed to RCN members. Of the 2,048 respondents, 149 worked mainly with children and young people. From their responses, quantitative data were analysed using a spreadsheet and free text data were analysed thematically according to the question topics. RESULTS: Only 34 per cent of respondents reported having enough time to devote to the dignity of patients and clients. Many respondents (74 per cent: sometimes; 8 per cent always) felt distressed or upset that they were unable to give the kind of dignified care they aspired to. The physical care environment and organisation influenced the provision of dignified care but respondents described how they endeavoured to promote dignity during care activities through thoughtful planning, communication and preserving privacy. CONCLUSION: Nurses can do much to promote the dignity of children and young people in their care.

AB  - The use of electronic monitoring tools in the workplace has grown dramatically because of the availability of inexpensive but powerful monitoring systems and the wide use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in today's workplace. However, existing research pays little attention to the pervasive use of electronic monitoring systems on ICT at work. This chapter draws theories in international and organizational cultures and concludes four hypotheses on privacy concerns of employees and their perceived trust to the management when being electronically monitored. © 2008, IGI Global.

AB  - This study had the objective of determining the way in which health professionals assess hospital services offered by their institutions, as well as identifying the core of social representations elaborated by those professionals regarding such institutions. A hundred and fifty-three questionnaires, applied in two hospitals (a state hospital and a charity hospital) in the metropolitan area of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, were analyzed. In the service assessment the Charity Hospital got the highest average score as for Service Quality. The state hospital presented the lowest average in the item "Respect for patient's privacy". The central categories were "Overpopulation" and "Humanized care" in both State and Charity hospitals, respectively. The peripheral categories were "Low wages" and "Overpopulation". Conducting an assessment is a very complex and important task. The assessment should become part of the organizational culture and guide improvements hospital care quality.

AB  - Employer attitudes and practices toward breastfeeding mothers are discouraging overall. Mothers who believe that breastfeeding while employed cannot be done without a considerable amount of additional work and stress may not even consider breastfeeding. Although it is known that lower income women tend not to breastfeed while employed, the relationship between type of employment and sustaining breastfeeding has not been clearly explained. Many women identify employment as a barrier to breastfeeding. Some elements of a workplace environment supportive of breastfeeding have been identified, including private space with a locking door (other than a bathroom stall), time to express milk at work, and adequate refrigeration. In relation to employers, monetary reasons (i.e., decreased productivity) are most frequently cited for not supporting breastfeeding. Only a small percentage of the research on employed breastfeeding mothers has focused on the workplace. Further research is needed to determine how breastfeeding can be beneficial to the mother, the infant, and the employer.

AB  - We report on the value sensitive design, development, and appropriation of a groupware system to support software engineering knowledge sharing. Usage data (5,965 visitors) and semi-structured interviews (18 individuals) suggest the methods employed were successful in addressing value tensions, particularly with respect to privacy, awareness, and reputation. Key contributions include: (1) "proof-of-concept" that established Value Sensitive Design principles and methods can be used to good effect for the design of groupware in an industry setting, (2) a new design method for addressing value tensions, Value Dams and Flows, and (3) demonstration of the co-evolution of technology and organizational policy. © 2007 ACM.

AB  - Objective: "Images of a Healthy Worksite" aims to provide easy access to healthful foods and to reduce sedentarism at the worksite - to prevent weight gain. Formative research for the nutrition intervention component was aimed at gaining a broad understanding of the sociocultural role of food and eating among workers and worker perspectives on socially feasible and culturally acceptable environmental intervention strategies. Research Methods and Procedures: Using an adapted PRECEDE health planning model, we conducted ecological, educational, environmental, and administrative assessments at the worksite. Through 15 in-depth interviews, five focus groups, and community mapping at two sites with 79 administrators, managers, workers, and food service personnel (51% men, 82% white), we assessed workers' perspectives on physical, sociocultural, economic, and policy environments. Data were coded for predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors related to intervention strategies in vending, cafeteria, catering, and informal food environments. After classification for reach, intensity, and sustainability, objectives and evaluation plans were developed for each highly ranked strategy. Results: Key sociocultural factors affecting food and eating included: stress-related eating in a downsizing workplace, enthusiasm for employer-sponsored weight gain prevention efforts that respect personal privacy, and the consequences of organizational culture on worker access to the food and eating environment. Workers supported healthier cafeteria and catering options, bringing healthful foods closer, and labeling of healthful options. Discussion: We provide a practical and systematic approach to formative research and assess the interrelatedness of the physical, policy, economic, and sociocultural factors that affect environmental worksite interventions to prevent weight gain among employees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving physician health and performance is critical to successfully meet the challenges facing health systems that increasingly emphasize productivity. Assessing long-term efficacy and sustainability of programs aimed at enhancing physician and organizational well-being is imperative. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether data-guided interventions and a systematic improvement process to enhance physician work-life balance and organizational efficacy can improve physician and organizational well-being. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: From 2000 to 2005, 22-32 physicians regularly completed 3 questionnaires coded for privacy. Results were anonymously reported to physicians and the organization. Data-guided interventions to enhance physician and organizational well-being were built on physician control over the work environment, order in the clinical setting, and clinical meaning. MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaires included an ACP/ASIM survey on physician satisfaction, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and the Quality Work Competence (QWC) survey. RESULTS: Emotional and work-related exhaustion decreased significantly over the study period (MBI, p=0.002; QWC, p=0.035). QWC measures of organizational health significantly improved initially and remained acceptable and stable during the rest of the study. CONCLUSIONS: A data-guided program on physician well-being, using validated instruments and process improvement methods, enhanced physician and organizational well-being. Given the increases in physician burnout, organizations are encouraged to urgently create individual and systems approaches to lessen burnout risk. © 2007 Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - Purpose - The aim of this research paper is to present the critical factors that constitute a successful implementation of lean manufacturing within manufacturing SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - A combination of comprehensive literature review and visits to ten SMEs based in the East of the UK were employed in the study. The companies' practices were observed to highlight the degree of lean manufacturing utilisation within these companies. This was followed by interviewing of the relevant and key personnel involved in lean implementation. Results were analysed and validated through workshops, case studies and Delphi techniques. Findings - Several critical factors that determine the success of implementing the concept of lean manufacturing within SMEs are identified. Leadership, management, finance organisational culture and skills and expertise, amongst other factors; are classified as the most pertinent issues critical for the successful adoption of lean manufacturing within SMEs environment. Research limitations/implications - Continued scepticism within SMEs about the benefits of lean to their business is one of the fundamental limitations this research faces. SMEs are, therefore, not very willing to provide useful information and data, timely for further investigation. Originality/value - The novelty of this research project stems from the realisation of critical factors determining a successful implementation of lean manufacturing within SMEs environment. The results would provide SMEs with indicators and guidelines for a successful implementation of lean principles. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article examines the relationship of employee perceptions of information privacy in their work organizations and important psychological and behavioral outcomes. A model is presented in which information privacy predicts psychological empowerment, which in turn predicts discretionary behaviors on the job, including creative performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Results from 2 studies (Study 1: single organization, W = 310; Study 2: multiple organizations, W = 303) confirm that information privacy entails judgments of information gathering control, information handling control, and legitimacy. Moreover, a model linking information privacy to empowerment and empowerment to creative performance and OCBs was supported. Findings are discussed in light of organizational attempts to control employees through the gathering and handling of their personal information.

AB  - This research aims to investigate how business policies may shape the competence of IS professionals in safeguarding information privacy. Grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior, two organizational contextual variables (codes of ethics concerning information privacy and expected consequences) and five variables of ethical decision making (ethical judgment, attitude toward privacy protection, norm, privacy self-efficacy, and ethical intention) are included in our research model. The results show that subjects in this study exhibit a higher level of ethical judgment, attitude toward privacy protection, subjective norm, and perceived privacy self-efficacy when organizations emphasize positive rewards to ethical behaviors, while the same cannot be said for the codes of ethics. In addition, an organizational context that emphasizes positive consequence may strengthen the relationships between ethical judgment and ethical intention and between attitude toward privacy protection and ethical intention. This demonstrates that a caring organizational climate plays an important role in ethical decision in computer use. Finally, the results show that when business do not have codes of ethics, employees' level of self-efficacy fluctuate much more widely than when businesses have codes. Thus, an organizational context that adopts codes of ethics can help strengthening the relationship between privacy self-efficacy and ethical intention. The implications to academics and business are discussed.

MCDS offers mechanisms for systematic detection, tracking, and management of emerging threat-structures in the context of the existing assets, algorithms for mining distributed multi-party data in a privacy-sensitive manner, archival and retrieval of case histories, and relevance feedback-based personalization. The paper provides an overview of a few modules and describes two ongoing applications of this collaborative problem solving technology. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Scholars in many disciplines have considered the antecedents and consequences of various forms of trust. This paper generates 11 propositions exploring the relationship between Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) and the trust an individual places in the inanimate technology (technology trust) and models the effect of those relationships on HRIS implementation success. Specifically, organizational, technological, and user factors are considered and modeled to generate a set of testable propositions that can subsequently be investigated in various organizational settings. Eleven propositions are offered suggesting that organizational trust, pooled interdependence, organizational community, organizational culture, technology adoption, technology utility, technology usability, socialization, sensitivity to privacy, and predisposition to trust influence an individual's level of trust in the HRIS technology (technology trust) and ultimately the success of an HRIS implementation process. A summary of the relationships between the key constructs in the model and recommendations for future research are provided. © CILIP.

AB  - This article describes the development and validation of a new measure of workplace incivility, the Uncivil Workplace Behavior Questionnaire (UWBQ). Participants included 5 samples of Australian adult employees (total N = 368). Principal axis factoring of the UWBQ yielded 4 interpretable factors (Hostility, Privacy Invasion, Exclusionary Behavior, and Gossiping), all of which exhibited high internal consistency. The 4-factor structure received further support from a confirmatory factor analysis on a hold-out sample. A series of correlation and regression analyses revealed that the UWBQ subscales exhibited sound convergent, divergent, and concurrent validity. The psychometric properties of the UWBQ are contrasted with those of the Workplace Incivility Scale (L. M. Cortina, V. J. Magley, J. H. Williams, & R. D. Langhout, 2001), to the authors' knowledge the only other measure of the workplace incivility construct available to date. Copyright 2005 by the Educational Publishing Foundation.

AB  - The UK Government published various circulars to indicate the importance of respecting the privacy and dignity of NHS patients following the implementation of the Human Rights Act, 1998. This research used an ethnographic method to determine the extent to which health professionals had in fact upheld the philosophy of these documents. Fieldwork using nonparticipant observation, and unstructured and semistructured interviews with patients and staff, took place over six months in three acute care wards in a large district NHS trust hospital. Applying the principles of phenomenology and grounded theory, the data were analysed and the contents organized into 11 key categories, leading to the formulation of a privacy model. The level of intrusion into patients' privacy by health professionals was measured against the benchmarking of the 'dignity and privacy' factors contained in the Department of Health's The essence of care document and Article 8(2) of the Human Rights Act. The findings established that patients had little privacy in the wards, and that the terms 'privacy of the person' and 'dignity' are interrelated. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, electronic performance monitoring (EPM) has increased dramatically. The managerial decision to implement an EPM system is important for it has significant implications for an organization. Even so, little attention has been paid by researchers to this decision. The present paper reviews the published research on EPM and identifies factors that probably impact this decision. A model is offered to help researchers identify relevant psychological and organizational variables that may impact the decision to implement an EPM system. Psychologically, issues of trust, privacy, social facilitation, justice beliefs and stress reactions must be considered. Organizationally, a firm's Human Resource strategy, organizational culture, and anticipated consequences of EPM (i.e., increasing performance, reducing theft) are also discussed. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Most older people living in 24-hour care settings have dementia. We employed qualitative interviews to explore positive and negative aspects of the experience of family carers, staff and people with dementia living in 10 homes in London and West Essex, selected to cover the full range of 24-hour long-term care settings. The interview used open semi-structured questions. We interviewed 21 residents, 17 relatives and 30 staff and five main themes were identified: Privacy and choice; relationships (abuse and vulnerability); activities; physical environment; and expectations of a care environment by carers, should they one day live in long-term care themselves. Despite being no longer responsible for the day-to-day care of the residents there was a continuing level of psychological distress among some relatives. We found that residents with a range of severity of dementia were able to participate. The most striking theme from their interviews was the need for choice. All groups talked about improving lines of communication amongst residents, relatives and staff and about the importance of activities. We recommend that homes should set up formal structures for engaging with user and carer views at all levels. This would mean relatives on the board, and regular meetings for residents, relatives, advocates and staff. This should lead to cultural changes where residents are perceived as individuals and care is provided in a more flexible way. There should be a programme of activities in each 24-hour care setting, which all care staff are given time to implement. These activities need to be tailored to the individual resident rather than the whole group. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - Increased usage of the Internet at work has prompted organisations to write Internet Usage Policies to establish appropriate use. This article addresses the main components of an Internet Usage Policy, including security, monitoring and filtering, privacy rights, intellectual property, organisation representation, acceptable personal use, unacceptable personal use, investigation of violations and corrective action, and notification of policy. Each section explains what should be written in the policy, and how it should be written. Internet Usage Policies should be tailored to fit the organisation's culture. Management must enforce the policies, but be careful not to act like big brother policing every activity employees engage in. Organisations will find that Internet Usage Policies provide a written basis for discouraging Internet misuse, but ultimately the organisational culture will have the strongest effect on employee behaviour. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the use of non-pharmacologic methods of pain management used by midwives in Lesotho. The research design was non-experimental and of a descriptive nature. The data was obtained by means of a structured questionnaire which was compiled after a thorough literature analysis was done. Midwives, working in the Maternity wards of the Christian Hospital Association of Lesotho as well as the government Hospitals completed the questionnaires. All data was analysed on a nominal descriptive level. According to the results, the midwives indicated that they were taught non-pharmacologic methods of pain management, however they expressed that they inadequately use these methods during the first stage of labour due to shortage of staff, lack of privacy and space, a high midwife-mother ratio, culture and hospital policies. In the light of these findings, recommendations were made of maximizing the use of non-pharmacologic methods during the first stage of labour.

AB  - This article describes and illustrates a framework that may be used when assessing the moral basis of everyday issues that can affect residents of assisted living facilities. The "taxonomy of everyday ethical issues" was an outcome of ethnographic research focused on care of nursing home residents with dementia. However, in this article it is shown to be equally relevant for conceptualizing issues affecting cognitively intact as well as cognitively impaired residents across these two settings. The taxonomy is grounded in some of the more common cultural characteristics of congregate living arrangements for elderly individuals who have needs for varying levels of compensatory and therapeutic oversight by a staff of service providers.

AB  - AIM: To determine the extent to which patients' rights to privacy and dignity are respected in the NHS when judged against the seven factors of 'privacy and dignity' as outlined in the Essence of Care document (Department of Health (DH) 2001a). METHOD: An ethnographic methodology was used. Fieldwork took place over six months in three acute wards with surgical and medical patients in a large district NHS hospital, using non-participant observation, unstructured interviews with patients (n=55) and staff (n=12), and semi-structured interviews with patients (n=18) and staff (n=22). The culture and ward environment experienced by patients and staff in their everyday life were documented. FINDINGS: Medical and nursing staff had little awareness of the importance of the Human Rights Act 1998 and government documents about patients' privacy. They compromised the privacy and dignity of patients when judged against the Essence of Care benchmarks (DH 2001a). CONCLUSION: Educationalists, doctors, nurses and other practitioners should promote the importance of patients' privacy and dignity within the NHS. This issue should be integrated into undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare curricula.

AB  - Discussion of the relationship between TQM and information and communications technology (ICT) normally focuses either on technological issues, or on the role of ICT in enabling the achievement of quality goals by means of business process reengineering. Less attention has been paid to the effects that the increased utilisation of ICT is having on management style, and on the quality of relationships. This paper reports on research undertaken into the development implementation and enforcement of codes of conduct designed to govern employees' use of ICT. A study of 125 London-based employers found that, although such codes had been introduced in nearly three-quarters of the organisations, the majority failed to address a key issue of concern to customers - privacy of personal data. Furthermore, the codes themselves were seen to have little influence on the behaviour of employees. The reasons for this are discussed within a TQM framework, and suggestions made as to how compliance might be improved in future.

AB  - Electronic business is based on using computers and networks in all aspects of business. This new business concept is developing its own culture, which faces many ethical dilemmas. One is the role of the chief information officer (CIO). As a leader of information technology application in the organisation, the CIO's ethical behaviour influences the ethics of the electronic business culture in the organisation. In electronic business both the chief executive officer (CEO) and the CIO are responsible for the organisational culture. That is, the CIO has capabilities for reasoning, forming values and making information decisions that contributes to creating corporate core values. From an employee's perspective the CIO is treated as the employer. But being employed by the organisation in a similar way to the rest of the employees, the CIO can also be treated as an employee of the organisation. This duality in the role of CIO causes ethical dilemmas that may be solved through establishing ethical codes that are based on existing global ethical codes. Explores the nature of ethical dilemmas related to e-business and proposes possible solutions, drawing on information from case studies of two Australian companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Drawing from previous research on individual differences, AIDS, and concerns for face, the author developed and tested a model examining the predictors (knowledge of AIDS transmission, level of homophobia, and concern for face) of AIDS fear and its organizational outcomes (perceived organizational consequences of hiring people living with HIV and attitudes toward disclosure of HIV-related information at the workplace). Data were collected using mail survey. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships among these variables for 160 human resource managers. All of the hypothesized relationships were empirically supported. Implications of the research findings for human resource practices are discussed.

AB  - • This study describes the application of grounded theory to establish older, south Asian patient and caret views of service delivery in the UK. The purpose of the study was to inform the development of culturally sensitive services by defining the concept of cultural sensitivity from a user/carer perspective. • The study took place in two community hospitals providing nurse-led intermediate care to a culturally diverse inner city population. Fifty-five per cent of the inner city population is of south Asian origin. Admissions to intermediate care, however, do not reflect the demography. • Recent reports commissioned by the Department of Health highlight the failure of the National Health Service in England to provide culturally sensitive services to black and Asian patients. The Department of Health is trying to redress this inequality providing policy guidance for improving access and cultural sensitivity in the British health care system. There is little existing empirical evidence, however, to clarify the concept of culturally sensitive care. • Patients and carers in this study described culturally appropriate care as that which respects individuality, creates mutual understanding, caters for spiritual need and maintains dignity. Older south Asian patients and their carets identified respect, understanding, spirituality and dignity as central to their conceptualization of cultural sensitivity. Their focus was on the nature of human relationships and their ability to interact in a positive way with staff. • The findings of this small piece of empirical research are limited by the sample size (four patients and three carets), but illustrate that cultural sensitivity, although complex, can be defined. This then provides a basis for developing appropriate care strategies. • One universal principle explicit in this research was that to be sensitive to culture staff must challenge their own assumptions and develop an understanding of the many layers of culture and subculture with which they are dealing. The starting point for any service is to understand the expectations of its users and to seek out and manage areas of conflict between organizational values and individuals' cultural requirements.

AB  - Recently introduced privacy legislation in Australia has required that professional associations approaching education from the perspective of human cases review their standards and develop new policies and procedures to protect the privacy of individuals. In this article, the author explores the disruption created for Clinical Pastoral Education by the introduction of these privacy laws, demonstrates that it is possible to be loyal to both a commitment to privacy and learning from "living human documents," develop strategies for changing the educational culture, and establish new procedures, strategies, and policy.

AB  - HIPAA mandates the development of privacy and security standards, including the designation of a privacy officer responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures. However, the rule does not give guidance as to the specific qualifications, job description, or details concerning policy and procedure development and implementation. The qualities and skills of informatics nurse specialists (INS), plus their commitment to patient advocacy and a professional code of ethics to ensure the privacy of confidential personal information, make the INS ideally suited to manage the processes necessary to achieve HIPAA compliance.

AB  - Security of information in the health care environment depends not so much on technical controls as on compliance with policy by all those who use the information. Awareness of policy and observance of a code of conduct, whilst important, do not itself ensure that staff respect confidentiality, let alone follow other measures to secure records. A culture of security must be developed throughout the health care community. This demands clear policy with practical procedures that are relevant in the workplace, a long-term programme in which changes can be introduced in a managed way that is sensitive to the tensions between security and other working practises, commitment from senior management to achieve change, and strong leadership from within the health care professions. The UK National Health Service has begun such a process with the endorsement of the 'Caldicott Committee Report on the review of patient-identifiable information' and its recommendation that all health organisations appoint a senior health care professional to be responsible for confidentiality of patient information. Raising the political profile of patient confidentiality has served to change the rate of change up a gear. The response of one health care community to this initiative will be discussed and lessons drawn regarding cultural change and information security. Copyright © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Recent advances in theories of learning and knowledge acquisition in culturally-situated environments have illuminated the role of cognition in changing behavior, and in turn on influencing performance for the long term. One such advance focuses on the relationship between explicit formal training and implicit knowledge acquired through daily interactive activities in schools and organizations. The former relates more to instruction regarding the policy issues whereas the latter is tied closely to cultural, moral and organizational values. In this paper, we draw on these theories of cognition and learning to show the shift in thinking that is needed regarding education of health professionals, including steps required to assure that the protection of confidential information becomes part of their routine practices. Illustrative examples are used to show the nature of conceptual change in the health professional's knowledge organization and reasoning strategies that is necessary for more sustained behavior change with regards to protecting data confidentiality and privacy of individual patients. This re-conceptualization is intended to be reflected at various levels of training and education for health professionals, including influences on personal and organizational practices as well as revisions in medical-school and graduate-medical curricula. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Theoretical models suggest that attitudes toward an employer's drug testing policy affect organizational climate and employee behavior, but empirical evidence has been scarce with limited external validity. Based on 66 manufacturing employees' questionnaire responses, attitudes toward drug testing significantly correlated with attitudes toward top management (r = +.39), support for employee safety (r = +.34), turnover intentions (r = -.31), and other variables. Although these data support a link between attitudes toward drug testing and employee withdrawal, they cannot address the issue of causality. Results suggest that perceived invasion of privacy is more strongly related to climate perceptions and turnover intentions than is perceived fairness.

AB  - This paper describes the empirical and theoretical development of a workplace training program to help reduce/prevent employee alcohol and drug abuse and enhance aspects of the work group environment that support ongoing prevention. The paper (1) examines the changing social context of the workplace (e.g., teamwork, privacy issues) as relevant for prevention, (2) reviews studies that assess risks and protective factors in employee substance abuse (work environment, group processes, and employee attitudes), (3) provides a conceptual model that focuses on work group processes (enabling, neutralization of deviance) as the locus of prevention efforts, (4) describes an enhanced team-oriented training that was derived from previous research and the conceptual model, and (5) describes potential applications of the program. It is suggested that the research and conceptual model may help prevention scientists to assess the organizational context of any workplace prevention strategy. The need for this team-oriented approach may be greater among employees who experience psychosocial risks such as workplace drinking climates, social alienation, and policies that emphasize deterrence (drug testing) over educative prevention. Limitations of the model are also discussed. © 2000 Society for Prevention Research.

AB  - We discuss the current policy, review its official rationale, and outline the various criticisms that have been made against it. Next, we suggest an alternative framework for the policy's persistence. Drawing on work in feminist theory, we argue that the military's restrictions on the service of lesbians and gay men reflects an institutional and cultural privileging of a heterosexual masculine ideal. We conclude by speculating on the interests that lie behind the perpetuation of this ideal of soldiering. © 1995 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.
